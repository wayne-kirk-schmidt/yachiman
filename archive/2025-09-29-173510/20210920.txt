moving on water
breath hovers over darkness
starting the process

enjoy the present
and cherish the fine moments
decorating life

no message will come
yet a response is heart held
and reaches us all

there is a firm end
the music, the hymn, the service
as all say amen

motion sliken black
flutters on thin fine bat wings
seeking home at night
