poised for moments now
legs bent, back arched, hands splayed out.
waiting for the start

small hand are searching
on the tabletop for pickles
then soon vanishing

the woods at twilight
are magical spooky worlds
filled with sounds and sighs

sooty old hearthplace
held blazes and toasty fires
still well remembered

turning on the winds
the owl silently dives down
seeking mice at dusk
