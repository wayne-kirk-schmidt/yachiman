search for your new heart
sift through the ashes for gold
and keep those nuggets

grand staircases spiral
up to heaven down to earth
and all through the world

looking at nature
an imprint of history
showing legacy

I do not see us
I see you and I see me.
no connection now.

no not speak falsely
but strive for the simple truths
they will serve you best
