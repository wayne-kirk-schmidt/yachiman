Old Mister Bromfeld
steps on the boardwalk whistling
seeing decades past

The end of the pier
calls barnacles and ghosts friends
when memories play

the water is frigid
deep with grey seaweed fingers
yet swim happily

I hold onto me
each day, story, victory
celebrating life

enduring noon heat
swelter in thin shade panting
yet I must go on
