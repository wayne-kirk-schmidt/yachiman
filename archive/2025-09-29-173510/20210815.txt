all along the wall
watchfires gutter and sputter
late into the night

not through the water
but through the sky fast fleeing
chasing the unknown

the plant strives to see
worlds of wonder in rainstorms
growth tracing new paths

all the animals
attend the Buddha daily
striving for peace

measured mountain steps
trace from peaks to the valleys
monks running daily
