sleep is so fickle
dodging, evading, smiling
but keeping aloof

what can you paint now?
a smile? a frown? a grimace?
as tears flutter down

build the bridges up
tear down again and again
nature of our lives

a lonely footstep
wedged in snow cold and alone
what could be the goal?

now we say good night
and enter our dreams boldly
as midnight comes fast
