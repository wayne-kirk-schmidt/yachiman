on the desert edge
lizards and mice frolicking
fine little motion

sliding along thin
snakes stretching effortlessly
in the deep shadows

croaking chorusing
our frogs call to each other
across the summer

first slicing the edge
the knife seeks the deepest heart
carving the short cake

finding our footing
walking from path to forest
finding adventure
