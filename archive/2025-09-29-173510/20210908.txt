flowering in rain
lasting for hours in water
the lotus blossom

turn and spin in time
dance and pull up your leg high
as the music guides you

I need to focus
on what things are real and pure
and not illusions

each day, eat right food
get sleep and rest completely
provides us our health

when the chairs are sat
in a ring with care, then we
see the game's true face
