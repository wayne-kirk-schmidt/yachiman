stark blue cathedral
aloof in the morning but
warm and red at night

linked hands encircle
as people dance in half time
to flutes also drums

from a great ruler
building the generations
yet dust has claimed them

not all hands that touch
have love abiding inside
proceed with caution

slow down and realize
each step and breath each moment
is a victory
