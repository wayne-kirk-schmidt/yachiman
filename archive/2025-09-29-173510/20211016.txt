sometimes it is hard
a frown, a tear, a harsh word
that leaves small gashes

nothing is left-back
when we pursue our real dream
and move things forward

what is legacy?
if we are lucky a web
woven with loving

the movements of stars
feel distant and cold, aloof
from the winter skies

touch on the far shores
with your hands touching soft sands
first to make landfall
