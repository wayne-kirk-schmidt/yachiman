my heart is beating
out of time and with the wind
as I sail away

the first taste is best
of love, of learning, of life
refining our meal

small and large, each soul
deserves respect and nurture
as we move along

I will call you then
on the day of the meeting
when our cares will cease

if faced with nothing
what would you do? then recant?
no. faith sees beyond.
