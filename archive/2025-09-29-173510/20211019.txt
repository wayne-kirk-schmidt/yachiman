move through the valley
sun sawing through nerves and shade
within the summer

corn gently moving
in the early morning breeze
along the farm roads

machine the metal
turn and lathe it, fashion it
into something lean

But I shall not stop
the monk explained when climbing
mountains reflect one

within a mirror
lie beauty and lurk danger
both equally seen
