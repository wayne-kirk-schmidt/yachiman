wet worms wriggling
playing after the storms have passed
among sunlit rocks

never but yet yes
mirrors in my mind speak with
me and the other

we go on. we move.
away from past to future
and set camp each day

listing my blessings
family is foundation
along faith and friends

but what is purpose?
compulsion to heed a call?
no. much more than that.
