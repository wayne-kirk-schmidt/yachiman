where were you in time?
when the beginning began?
when the end was done?

sailing cold oceans
sit and laugh and make merry
unaware of ice

tea blends and mixes
in the pot and in the cup
giving warmth and sight

I sit my bones down
and let the world move on by
feeling good to rest

we could spend the month
filled with glorious mornings
exploring each other
