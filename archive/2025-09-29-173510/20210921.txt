nothing held onto
when waves wash the tears away
leaving us scoured clean

the birds sing and shout
in their language in morning
but we hear sweet sounds

jogging past the cat
crouched on the boulder at dusk
run past in the park

the notes are copied
faithfully, denoting hymns
to be sung at mass

we dress loneliness
in vintage clothes faded greys
that reflect years past
