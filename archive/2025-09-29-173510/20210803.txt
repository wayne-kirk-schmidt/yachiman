simple steps repeat
on a path of reflection
to reach nirvana

a simple vow said
not narrow or broad in view
but the middle way

running assures us
with the rhythm and the gait
our pulse keeping time

hands press so lightly
to the new face sleeping deep
welcome family

dancing regally
acting out our pain and joy
on a stage all see
