obey the masses?
follow for following's sake?
some things should not be.

ask the clouds for sight
through the future, beyond past,
and vision to be.

finish the verses
weaving meaning from nothing
reflecting true feelings

gazing into now
blessed with the past and future
we know what to do

I will mourn them all
and celebrate them as well
honoring their lives
