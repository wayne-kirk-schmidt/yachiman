paddling in puddles
water skimmer moves in bliss
as the rain goes on

test the recipe
a simple taste a quick check
to prepare the meal

I collect my things
from here, from life, and always
used to build the next

not that we can see
life continues with passion
and celebrates love

the abbess plants seeds
and she waters them with words
to grow our ideas
