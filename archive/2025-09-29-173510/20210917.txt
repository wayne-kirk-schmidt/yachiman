laughing outside me
the joy bouncing off of trees
while looking at leaves

simple rivers flow
downside, alongside, the slopes
of serene mountains

the ax whistles low
humming with direct purpose
we flinch at the swing

presenting wrapped bones
left from parents, children, more
as they moved beyond

the script thinly hides
the love in writing true things
each prayer book page
