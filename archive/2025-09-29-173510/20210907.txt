sometimes the best way
is backward and falling down
making the path clear

when does the heart beat?
at birth? in life? or in death?
but always in love.

regarding the mirror
seeing past growing shadows
into the bright light

moving stones each time
lessen burdens for children
builds up the whole world

each saying is viewed
by others spoken before
to find the first one
