voices of angels
whisper of the rest in heaven
walking in the clouds

my heart is breaking
who then can mend it, heal it?
look to the mirror

noting the spider
spinning webs beautifully
in the morning sun

pumpkins shining bright
with dew and internal fires
on all hallows mass

what is a haunting?
making us all catch our breath
in the evening
