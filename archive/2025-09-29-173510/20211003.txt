rare little kingdoms
peopled by princes and queens
captured in stone

pain can be useful
instructive helping cleansing
if we see past it

apples growing quick
up into a lush orchard
covering gravesites

snakes slithering
within the grass in the sun
moving to the sea

finally at dusk
when we place down all our tools
and we will then sleep
