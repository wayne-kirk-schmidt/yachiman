under the flagstones
rests accumulated dirt
the result of age

keep close to my heart
young song and hopeful dreaming
they are part of me

golden silver bells
ring and sing, yet cry and laugh
voicing their passions

what could you expect?
slow time? stop? even reverse?
no. pursue your path.

the fine wine ages
on the shelf and in the cup,
within us also
