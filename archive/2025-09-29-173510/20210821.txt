those pointing fingers
blind themselves by the shadows
cast from their beliefs

gazing at the truth
we see greys, not black and white
why? our eyes see parts

when I see pictures
time bridges itself and we
again have moments

move the watch ahead
measuring seconds minutes
fulfilling the days

to sit down and eat
home cooked meals and drink water
a wonderful treat
