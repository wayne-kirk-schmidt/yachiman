one step into warmth
all it takes to thaw the heart
one step into love

I do not know them
but I can see their actions
see their legacy

what shall I then breathe?
water, snow, or dew? something else?
deeply this cold day

sensing the losses
of faith, of love, of caring
the husk stumbles on

at the very end
of the bay a silver ring
gleams at the bottom
