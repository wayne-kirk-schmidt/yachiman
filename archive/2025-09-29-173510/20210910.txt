stairs are not that hard
simple stepping repeated
always climbing up

truths cover trauma
like pearls, like scars, healing closed
distancing the pain

can you recall now
the first kiss and soft embrace
and how your heart felt

pebbles circling
around boulders around stone
teach us about flows

clarity of sutras
do not change our firm duty
seek and help others
