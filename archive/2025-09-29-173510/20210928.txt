angels and demons
crash into each other now
within my spirit

bridging waves on rocks
the rope hangs from tree to shore
defining holy

our single staff strikes
the stones as the path is trod
for our pilgrimage

each generation
sits with itself and reflects
on the good and bad

the homeward bound dove
glides and soars bursting with pride
bringing promises
