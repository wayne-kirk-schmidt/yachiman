consider the cost
when speaking in haste or ire
now and later on

presenting my view
can be tougher on me than you
best done with some care

I can see the rain
moving in great sheets and bursts
washing away pain

witness silently
the ages from the dark ledge
as the years wear down

do not be detoured
from your true and righteous task
find and pursue it
