spark of life jumps up
in seconds within the heart
as we gaze outside

very good or bad
slightly evil mostly pure
really a balance

one point on a line
assures others of the whole
counting continues

on stone and on clay
thumbprints, then lines, then letters
record the days long past

grains as the main gift
salt also wine alongside
to present to gods
