Stopping in the fields
the farmer gazes at crops
before summer rains

seeds are sown in spring
summer tended carefully
thence be harvested

lightning strikes the air
jagged, roaring a challenge
from swirling storm clouds

a simple disk spins
purest light, sheer energy
tool also weapon

striking the silver
light yields and bends yet not broke
within the mirror
