they stood for decades
and in the blink of an eye
they were suddenly gone

in truth the living
have much to learn from the dead
the lessons of faith

an imam walking
along the path to the saint's tomb
along with the priest

pushing carefully
we move boulders and small stones
to make the way straight

no greater love than
tending to others as well
as caring for you
