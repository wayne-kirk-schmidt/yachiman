it stares back at you
the house the walls the front yard
as you look beyond

step into the waves
as the seventh crashes down
washing away fear

ready for today
yesterday and tomorrow
pivot through the hours

we need our first steps
to see where we started from
to plan where to go

hawks fly quietly
gliding through the air at dawn
looking piercingly
