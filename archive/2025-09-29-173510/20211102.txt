wandering all night
pilgrims stumble across truth
when they all approach

find the seat of love
within the seas of passion
between loneliness

kittens and puppies
children at heart learn to be
what they see around

eyes upon us all
looking, shaping our actions
and molding ourselves

sitting on a throne
what do we survey or rule?
where does ruling start?
