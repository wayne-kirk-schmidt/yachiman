walking in your shoes
ancient paths and worn choices
walking in my shoes

will we reconcile?
in this life? or the next one?
what can heal that wound?

remember a bar
where a young bright smile
a beautiful start

memory sketches
in watercolor and inks
rarely paints in oils

looking at the hall
full of gentle loving ghosts
keeping silent watch
