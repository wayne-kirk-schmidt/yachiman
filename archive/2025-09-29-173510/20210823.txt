breaking secrets down
flushing out the false faces
building new belief

dust covers your heart?
only if you let it blanket
something that won't move

finish the great work
lift it, test yourself, stagger
but yet continue

In the morning sun
I want to see the rabbi
before quit of day

finally when done
we rest next to worn stones
that stopped rolling now
