wailing in ashes
simply crying for the lost
we move through beyond

we move through and more
as we learn, grow, fail, succeed
following the path

push the door and close
the old chapter for the new
on both sides of life

what was my name then?
before I became myself?
what will it become?

sitting near oceans
I wait and laugh as small waves
dance in my shadow
