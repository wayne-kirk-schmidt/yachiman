fly back to the nest
from time to time can be wise
building on instinct

when we stand in light
when we walk in the darkness
our shadow follows

think on not thinking
while not looking at nothing
contemplating zen

the master lies down
and the novice walks a mile
both have done service

what shall it be then?
to polish or crack mirrors?
reflecting heaven
