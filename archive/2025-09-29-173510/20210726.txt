did we miss this now?
when we look at the wet ground
after the rains fell

push people to be
to look to act to feel more
to become better

I wish I could tell
when love starts and finishes
but I wait like you

horizon tells us
wait for the dawn, look further
walking from the dusk

merge the hearts and minds
onto a stage barely seen
bedecked with caring
