heron cries at night
faintly bathed in the moonlight
crying out alone

across the water
smooth stones wetly skip speeding
leaving small ripples

plastering kisses
the small child is so fearless
loving the parents

in order to change
practice mindfulness daily
but do you want to?

high castles and forts
stand alone with walls and moats
waiting for others
