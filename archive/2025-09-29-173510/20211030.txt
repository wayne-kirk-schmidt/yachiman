spend it wisely now
invest it in good actions
the time and effort

not far from the flame
moths dance and sing happily
knowing what awaits

but I cannot see
the limits of you or me
so we test ourselves

does silence help us?
No. it harms. it withers us.
speak out and stand up.

quickly turn and twirl
on the huge bright stage blurring
dancing for us all
