first steps of a path
precious also and special
providing wonders

spinning fine threads
into a broad rich fabric
building on those strengths

wading in oceans
the shells and sand surround us
celebrating life

simple toys follow
the hearts and minds from our souls
springing from our play

make the idea live!
take the steps, make the effort
forging our purpose
