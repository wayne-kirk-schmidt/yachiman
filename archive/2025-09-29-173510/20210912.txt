mention it say now
the things that come from the heart
spoken earnestly

if change is for sure
and if I stare at old me
what will I then see?

Hearts need space to rest
after majestic effort
and reflect on peace

blocks of ache cement
the minarets of result
our accomplishments

sayings are special
and then get often retold
as the prophets change
