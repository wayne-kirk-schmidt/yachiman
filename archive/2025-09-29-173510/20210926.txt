Annabelle the ant
sweeps the dust in small patterns
and observes dharma

What is mindfullness?
Focus on a task or more?
Or roadway to truth?

We gain and we lose
revolving and evolving
We grow to be more

Handstands in the sand
water tickling our toes
we frolic in fall

night sounds caress ears
telling and calling others
beautiful patterns
