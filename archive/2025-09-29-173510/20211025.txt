moving the heavens
moving mountains and rivers
moving emotions

nothing can cross this
as the line is drawn in dust
yet it is erased

circles widening
drawn in air pleasantly done
run around our heads

get away from this
and swim in rivers and lakes
avoid the bustle

and we close our eyes
and a new day attends us
while we breath it in
