never mind the dark
it is only the slim shadows
of what is real here

who is the monster?
who is the knight or the witch?
or are they the same?

I look at the cake
and see the candles with pride
as they tell a tale

we enjoy our days
build on them also weave them
into love stories

simple bow tied
around the head, neck, or waist
a badge of honor
