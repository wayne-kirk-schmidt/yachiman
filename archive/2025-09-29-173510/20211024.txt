Life demarcated
in moments, birth, school, love, more
wonderful clock hands

simple white shines bright
shining and glowing beacons
bracketing pure black

fifteen voices joining
plainsong weaving melody
celebrating now

honest ghosts whisper
We are with you and help you
standing behind you

pushing the passion
into the hot crucible
to build something more
