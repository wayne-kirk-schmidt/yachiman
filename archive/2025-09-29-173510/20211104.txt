Not for me to say
on the ledge of the high rise
as the moon rises

swinging on the rope
enjoying the pitch and rise
knowing it will break

move the waters now
parting seas, calming a storm
patiently fishing

when forces of light
meet with the hordes of darkness
who do we think wins?

the prince and princess
sit on lonely thrones and wait
for the kingdom to rise
