song sung at morning
rings through the soul during day
and, at night, felt still

dark water moving
as the rains come showering
within the torrents

simple passions rule
such as when to eat or sleep
and we build on them

when you run from you,
can you really escape you?
or, come back to you.

that hunger is known
the thirst also keenly felt
as the pilgrim moves
