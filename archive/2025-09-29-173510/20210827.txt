let us test the fire
bring worn and smoldering love
to kindle anew

the hounds are anxious
prior to the approaching storm
with lightning dancing

orange and green hues
within the dimly lit glass
limned with faint wonder

from rock thus to egg
to heartfelt life; all things strive
and seek completion

walking the streets see
present future and long past
merged into one
