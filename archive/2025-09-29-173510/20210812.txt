step into the light
accept more also do more
it is only right

presently our sight
limited by our life finds
special new beauty

movements in mountains
at first small, then large, then small
appear and then fade

Can we rest our thoughts?
Take a small nap from the cares
or is that a dream?

try walking on snow
crunching icy underfoot
as cold air shines bright
