mothers looking now
past grass and flowers so green
sprouting in stone gaps

brushing my soul now
combing strands of confidence
making them pretty

flowing on rivers
barges moving wooden biers
to consume the old

single notes herald
the descent on golden stairs
while man is asleep

we have watched you now
for thousands of years and more
till our duty's end
