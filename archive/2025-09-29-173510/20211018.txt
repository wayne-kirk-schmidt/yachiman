smiling we welcome
the newborn into our world
dreaming of future

testify to the faith
that moves you and keeps us all
curious and safe

movements of the heart
match being that we bathe in
oceans of the soul

the dark waters break
on the dim shores in grey light
shadows of new life

regarding ourselves
within frames we move and move
mirroring action
