And at once this starts
with a look and with a breath
and a connection

could you be in love?
consumed by flames of passion?
only time will tell

along the dry steppes
from mountains to desert valleys
move horse and rider

within the lotus
exists beginnings and ends
opened by wisdom

of the thirteen
whose souls spans across ages
simple true mirrors
