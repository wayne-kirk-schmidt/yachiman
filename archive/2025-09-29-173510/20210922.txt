when we sat down then
the fading light of summer
splashing faint color

postcards of belief
sent by heaven for our need
guide all the same way

best to thank others
those whose lives lent us our strength
those who live in us

walking through the sand
dreaming of green seas and waves
that flowed long ago

the petals drip dew
in the bright brisk morning air
inviting us now
