all we can do best
is to touch, try, and then teach
helping loving all

it does take effort
understand differences
but well worth the time

speaking in old tongues
touching on speech long time gone
touching ancestors

simplest soup pots filled
herbs, fish, and vegetables
simmer and beckon

time to dust off Gods
who live in all of our shrines
in the heart or home
