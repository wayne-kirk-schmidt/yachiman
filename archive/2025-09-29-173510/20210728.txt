stones lie amid snow
warming frozen visitors
beautifully grey

dark storms howl and rage
hurl lightning, winds, and water
then comes the bright sun

in studying hands
look at veins, muscles, the bone
layers of living

What does a bowl have?
shape? depth? strength? Anything else?
the love that made it.

a moth that flitters
between dusty books and shelves
uses learned wings
