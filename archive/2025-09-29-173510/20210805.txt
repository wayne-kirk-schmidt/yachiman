what makes up secrets?
the need to hide? to be gone?
or something else then?

long through the nighttime
a solitary bird cries
mourning the unknown

fish within the pond
gaze up, gaze out, gaze beyond
looking at strange worlds

one step in all ten
feels good, and on reflection
builds up the resolve

new path in the night
the next stage in a journey
made with firm desire
