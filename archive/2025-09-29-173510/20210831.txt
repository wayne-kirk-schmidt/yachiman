stones what can you show?
hearts and minds of yesterday?
no only raindrops

the kind and queen sit
on thrones of alabaster
cold and unyielding

if we can move sand
into castles overrun
by the morning tide

the birds sadly cry
along the seashore washed clean
by the winter rains

is the perfect spot
in the middle or outside?
both? or neither?
