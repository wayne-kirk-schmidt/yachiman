do prime numbers dance
within a real symphony?
imaginary.

move the rock aside
just as stones were cast away
by asking questions

at the end of tears
the soul refreshed tells us truth
"begin it anew"

on the sound structure
made in turmoil baked in stress
also glazed in peace

the teaching is small
every lesson a step
but yet progress builds
