Ptolemy told us
stressing each spoken sentence
quiet gentle truths

doves quietly grieve
how would their tears seem to us?
would we even know?

I started the slope
with the best of intentions
deciding to climb

silent plumes of steam
gush sulfur, and acrid spray
at the murky gates

nothing truly lost
we may forget, we may miss
but will remember
