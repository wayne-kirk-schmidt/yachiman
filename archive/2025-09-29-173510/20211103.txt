cleanse the night air
sweep away the old; prepare
for the new bright dawn

could I have asked you?
to stay? to be forgiven?
no. the road goes on.

reflecting backward
on that night so cool and light
from the restaurant

single yellow rose
given gladly to her now
signified the love

when we reach the wall
stopping to pray and swaying
for them, for us all
