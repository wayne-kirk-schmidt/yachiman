hearts want what they want
and plead for passions to rise
stoked by caresses

no, we can find peace
resting in the spaces between
love, anger, and loss

present the keys now
unlocking all the secrets
as we share them all

regular rhythm
marks time in well-penned sections
guiding the music

what is the smallest
things to fulfill our base needs?
sometimes best to ask
