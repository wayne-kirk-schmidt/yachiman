broken pottery
resting in breathless moments
just after the fall

try this and then see
if the wine of the past gives
new comprehension

what can be now gleaned
from the barren stubbled field?
the ghosts of past crops

carrots and peas sit
on the plate steaming slightly
the meal for the monk

by walking for hours
road blurs into a white line
calls to the weary
