testing the windows
rattling the locks looking
for a way inside

the foam on the waves
decorates swells from dark depths
as the tide comes in

not much of my heart
dwells on the past, instead looks
towards the future

the notes hang on air
where chords lead us to new places
while we sing them all

What was our Babel?
where we looked at the heavens
and said, so shall we
