we taste new flavors
of the soup made of our lives
added and stirred

meals made lovingly
attend the generations
passionate mile stones

presenting the past
and unveiling the future
within my mind's eye

different colors
mixing in composition
delivering joy

single yellow rose
given in a bar one night
still brings a wide smile
