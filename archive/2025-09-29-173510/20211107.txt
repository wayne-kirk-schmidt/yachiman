once we have closed doors
we come to the next crossroads
deciding our next steps

sipping cool water
trickles down the grateful throat
simple remedies

standing in stark lines
queueing for their sea entry
penguins lithely move

riding along roads
the miller, abbess, and knight
exchanging stories

twenty days and nights
walking alone and yet no
within the desert
