glinting in the sun
metal expresses beauty
reserved for weapons

regarding towers
defiantly claiming rights
albeit brief ones

starting at the bay
walking to the park and more
during summer days

the memory is fine
moonlit and white bright they stood
as we then flew by

staring at the stone
placed three hundred years prior
summarizing life
