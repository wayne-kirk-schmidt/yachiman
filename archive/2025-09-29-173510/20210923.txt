foaming waves crash down!
sweeping, bathing the beaches
yet dancing always

once you write something
it lives. breathes, and yearns free
so, give it their chance

try the legs walking
slowly wobbling and gaining
strength as we learn how

the souls of your house
are they people? pets? something more?
actions and emotions

we populate love
with our tiny figurines
but it is stronger
