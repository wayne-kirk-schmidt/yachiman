now that we can crawl
we start to look at walking
walking, dream of flight

the feathers moving
create swirling gusts of wind
which bathe us all

look at the islands
ask yourself are they for me?
singular beauty

I read the prayer
sent to heaven from my heart
for the sake of peace

nearest tall towers
is a church, humble and kind
which cares for the flock
