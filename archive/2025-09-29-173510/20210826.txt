deftly hands shape clay
quickly molding potential
prior to fiery kiln

questions on my mind
sit and wait and swim and fly
waiting for answers

the smallest kitten
looks at the lion and can see
the clear heritage

the house has stood tall
as it always has and will
a beacon of home

walking through the mist
we see ghosts of almost been
singing so softly
