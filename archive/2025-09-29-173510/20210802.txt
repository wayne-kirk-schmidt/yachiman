slithering downward
coiling, water slides, and pools
deep blue-green eyes watch

regard altarpieces
seeing the truth instead of
dim lit memories

consent to heaven
working with us and through us
blesses all of us

ground, crushed and heated
the iron and sand mix to make
steel within the forge

etching royal claim
on the blade, the ring, the crown
but backed by virtue
