push the boundary
to see what goal you can reach
and where that will go

not all stairs lead up
but both down and then around
and captures our mind

read from the tablet
baked in a kiln ages past
dear sir it began

sharpening the knife
to cut meat and butter bread
and then make our meal

staring at armor
and imagine the field where
where it had a need
