tears won't flow downward
and they will not wick skyward
but they will pool here

but say it once then
and understand we aren't here
but we have moved on

feast of all the saints
when we try to remember
those who came before

a circle of pearls shines
blue and white, and greenly pink
showing odd beauty

if put on a stage
faith shines and stands up haughty
best to be in hearts
