staring at the sand
crabs think of water and fish
and the gentle sun

no, we go forward
not behind and not away
learning all the while

old friends and lovers
reflections of past choices
all to be cherished

nothing in the hall
catches the weight of silence
or sees the shadows

Old man smiles and sighs
on beautiful life around
and keeps walking on
