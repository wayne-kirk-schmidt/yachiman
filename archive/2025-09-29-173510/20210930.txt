stand right there! don't move.
and we wait for the time when
we move from that where

decorating hearts
with sighs and soft caresses
we remember them

but to ask for time
is audacious since we all
borrow from that well

sit and simply look
at the wall and at the moon
as the night marches

simple heart tattoo
masks passions with silences
care worn but with pride
