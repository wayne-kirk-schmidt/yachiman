on the watchtower
we saw the storm approaching
with mournful music

stepping with one three
watching silent beats move us
with two four sliding

do not regret it
the pain and joy also rage
all can be soul food

simple white holding watch
where seagulls float serenely
over ink-black seashores

hurtling through the night
to a morning stop away
running to arrive
