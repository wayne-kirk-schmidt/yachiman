gently take my hand
and lay it soft on your face
as we fall asleep

harsh light and crisp air
framing the budding morning
possibilities

move inside and wait
for the waiting to finish
and for something new

the old me sees past
future me turning around
to greet me right now

place of reckoning
prepared to offer prayers
and meet our maker
