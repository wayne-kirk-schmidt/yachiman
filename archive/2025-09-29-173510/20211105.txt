not everything dies
hope, love, faith will continue
after we are gone

tunneling through grief
we see the light at the end
when we live one more

we know circling
our soul is our memories
disguising our selves

not what we wanted
what we desperately need
fulfilling the void

ice coats the senses
as winter descends on love
as the snows approach
