do bugs have souls then?
something that carries on after?
if them also then us

and I read the book
within holds matters of life
and I consider

when the cake is done
fresh smells thickly flood the house
act of love complete

after work is done
satisfaction creeps up quick
to say then, "well done"

along the mountain
faithful trek into morning
to glimpse the sunrise
