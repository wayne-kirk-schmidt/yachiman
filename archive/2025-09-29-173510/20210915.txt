clock tiptoes on hours
dances with minutes twirling
and waltzes with days

stately music speaks
pianos and violins
expressing themes

sand sifts and slides down
dunes and beaches tumbling quick
to join the sea bed

try understanding
instead of accusing now
and seek harmony

raised voices smashed glass
litters the street glittering
the aftermath of rage
