abide here awhile
rest well and consider time
as it passes by

the abbot takes tea
and in looking at the leaves
glimpses the Buddha

if you were able
to build the most perfect bridge
where would it lead you?

following sentences
as they skip, dance, trip, and fall
within our bookends

become quiet and calm
reflecting everything
and gazing on truth
