nothing pushes back
when looking within the void
the circle is wide

eat the whole apple
savor each bite after bite
then planting the seeds

did I know of you?
when I was born? when I grew?
or was it later?

soup simmers slowly
mixing and blending the broth
steaming in morning

no, we have the past
as a book, but not a shrine.
to help prepare us
