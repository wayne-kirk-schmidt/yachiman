trust me when I say
that life is glorious and rich
with your heart's treasures

can I say to you
"enough. we are completed"
to have us finish?

ask the little thing
the larger things will follow
small to large to small

simple barley grain
gaining shape within water
to produce a meal

while drinking think of
simple, pure water fills us
within, defines us
