nothing grows there now
when gazing at the smoking
rubble of the heart

moving through the snow
along foggy mountain trails
breath swirling in ice

it was a yule tree
we carried from the outside
decorated with love

when the heart says stay
then we abide and linger
pursuing our feelings

if we gaze on them
and then gaze on us through them
what will our age see?
