some piece of me rests
between now and what could be
balanced in moments

wafts of hope drifting
over the debris of the war
seeking to rebuild

when the dust settled
amid the rubble and smoke
past echoes of me

we move through the sea
swimming and gliding with ease
marveling at life

if we could pick it
perfect times to love deeply
would we do this still?
