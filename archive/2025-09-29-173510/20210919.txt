Truly I say now
Finally when we finish
We see tracks of love

dust moving around
pockets swirling quickly up
to meet the new day

traces of loving
remain in the raw wounds
bittersweet rubble

we lash out sometimes
in pain and in anger. why?
because we know-how

cling to hope and light
work to make the world better
people remember
