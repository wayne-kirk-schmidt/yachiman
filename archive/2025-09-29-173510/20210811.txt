Of the sand and dust
lightly littering the streets
we see faint echos

the mold takes raw clay
and, with time and care, hardens
a vessel for more

now that I could see
through dark haze and thick fog banks
I look for my steps

within the forest
silent verdant vigilance
descends around you

kitten sees a cat
who then sees the kitten twice
in front and within
