head is full of fog
and the eyes water with dust
in the grand journey

provide the soup pot
put in carrots, yams, and broth
making simple feasts

sound the gong again
we ride against rage and hate
to spread love and peace

nothing is rigid
sand, sea, people, they all change
governed by patterns

walk under branches
to listen to the trees breath
and witness their life
