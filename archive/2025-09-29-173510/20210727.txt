Enoch spreads his arms
and walks the ground carefully
attended by hosts

looking to the earth
from clouds longing to descend
yet he must stay still

Be the king; rule well
and build the house of your heart
guard it very well

we shall reach the host
with bricks and stones and mortar
climbing so quickly

the birds flew around
and settling to their own nests
as the day crawls home
