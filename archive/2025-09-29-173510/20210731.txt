cicadas chirping
briefly walking among us
then continuing

the keyhole stares back
when I look deep into space
imagining keys

comets move slowly
and the tip of their orbits
then hurtle back in

what moves people on?
habits? passions? convictions?
a blend of them all

great stories show us
message within messages
and ask us to look
