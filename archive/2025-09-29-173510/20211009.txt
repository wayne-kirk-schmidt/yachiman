young voices singing
repeating joy, spreading peace
for the future choir

will we be able
to reflect on our past deeds
and hold our heads high?

clanging noises reach
the heart as thrumming rumbling
beats that can guide us

what is sacrifice?
an ideal? something hazy?
no. acts for each day.

the blood price to pay
something that is demanded
fulfilling the pact
