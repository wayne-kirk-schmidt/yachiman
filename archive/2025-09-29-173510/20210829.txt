Puzzling through it
we see the outline of life
and see how things were

present my heart now
not as a blind offering
but a firm promise

walking down the stairs
we stumble and fall and then
only to rise up

sweetest tasting drinks
are small sips of cold water
after the day of work

laying my head flat
listening to our heartbeats
calms the restless soul
