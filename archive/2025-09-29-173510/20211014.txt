the haze burns away
the morning remains shining
in the space of hours

simple droplets fall
splashing into lakes forming
liquid memories

what is sent but kept?
what is hoarded also shared?
love, care, and regards

now listen my child
when I speak of lofty spires
from pages in a book

the bend in the road
a lazy summer beacon
promising a rest
