confounding senses
wafting perfume floats on by
playfully dancing

what then is evil?
something we can agree on?
the thing to oppose?

but I do not choose
to swim with morning ocean
instead, walk the shore

a simple ball intrigues
oldest dog and youngest cat
both wanting to play

when the last leaves fall
making crimson and fawn beds
the forest is pleased
