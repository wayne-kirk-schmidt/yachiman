nothing on the edge
just ice, steam, water droplets
remnants of passage

pure water settles
into the being, spreading
healing, strengthening

must we kill to eat?
yes, a grim necessity
best we have respect

floating on the pond
lilies and fronds newly cut
by all the swimmers

find the strength to stand
and say "this is what I want"
seek purposefully
