running from shadows
but stop! and embrace them now.
they are also you

shrugging off the earth
in a jump through the crisp air
on that final day

go to the pier's edge
and stare into the water
reflect on the past

slinking, jauntily
the boat slices through the Charles
as the pilot smiles

nothing is foreign
and all things are considered
for their own beauty
