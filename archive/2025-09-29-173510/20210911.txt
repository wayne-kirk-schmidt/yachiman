tears in each raindrop
falling on the hopeful hands
clutching rosaries

never mind the dark
it wraps us and helps us see
the starting of light

when you ask for more
be sure to return those gifts
and more in you thanks

no sure thing walks small
instead swims deep and runs far
as all sure things do

try as I might now
I only see the outline
dimly and briefly
