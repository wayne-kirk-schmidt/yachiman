molten droplets rain
from each blow as steel is wrought
from glowing rivers

gazing on the past
inflames old passion and aches
instead, see anew

I move the ball now
each step zigzagging with speed
but toward what goal?

Newton looks upwards
to skies, to apples, to stars
and sees even more

As the Sutra says
No mind, no passion, no pain
but enlightenment
