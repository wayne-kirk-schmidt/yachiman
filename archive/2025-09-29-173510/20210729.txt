music created
valleys, chasms, and mountains
within our own soul

Do not ask for more
Yet, ask to see more, do more
and from that gain more

moving on the floors
the crusts and scraps tantalize
families of mice

was it so strange then
to see a young mouse and bear
meet, love, and grow wise

in each heart chamber
dear souls of all the others
celebrating bonds
