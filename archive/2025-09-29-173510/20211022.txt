try your hand at this
monk said to the acolyte
and see what happens

writing the scriptures
recollection from before
discussing great things

the children see us
and they may view reflections
of future and past

moving carefully
through the dusty dark houses
within memory

at the end of it
the tunnel opens we see
what we labored for
