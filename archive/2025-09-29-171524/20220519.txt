butterflies moving
slow then faster then blurring
within fresh spring fields

strange that the world sleeps
but stars do not, burning white
until the fires dim

arcing through the dark
dust and rocks, gas, even more
dancing around worlds

simple waters carve
change through rocks and earth and yet
soil guides the torrent

bronze and silver bells
ring true and pure notes above
sleeping neighborhoods
