present memory
with the finest bright jewels
glittering coldly

progress wiggling
along all the ups and downs
slowly going on

we measure and pray
looking for signs in the dawn
waiting for the day

yes the world will spin
and tottle and wobble but
then correct itself

faith is foundation
science and logic follow
complementary
