keeping up with time
fast as grey ice and slow as dark
creeping in silence

creeping slowly down
green furry inchworm delights
hanging from fine leaves

hanging upside down
the sloth a ballerina
of stately motion

plowing through blue-black
ships slice oceans easily
on the horizon

among the white tombs
see flowers cans and incense
for our ancestors
