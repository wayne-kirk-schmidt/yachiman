time ticking green
days sliding in yellow grey
night waltzing in blue

dip into the ice
crunching soft building ridges
put into water

from heaven at first
organization descends
building ziggurats

bronze molten smoking
hooves flash red into the earth
sizzling with movement

houses and temples
shelter ideas so precious
you can belong here
