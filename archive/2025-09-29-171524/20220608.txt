simple yellow black
suit coats float among flowers
pollen streaming down

sullen clouds sulking
light of rain though dark green-grey
speeding across skies

simple spring pleasures
acrid fresh breezes whipping
across the nostrils

within the waters
inside wells at the bottom
contain history

bronze is the tenor
iron basso profundo
silver soprano
