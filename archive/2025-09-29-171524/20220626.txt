and we shall hear blue
in the sky, the sea, and clouds
equally away

trumpets are silent
glittering at pearly gates
waiting for the time

the monk, sitting down,
reads the scriptures and writes songs
brown with white and black

the abbot sweeps dust
into piles into rivers
smiling at dharma

vibrant chalks and dust
creating Buddha visions
which will disappear
