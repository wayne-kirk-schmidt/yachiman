lace yields and crumbles
from age, from tears, from neglect
white now yellowing

lances and needles
moving and piercing the skin
silver drawing red

pages stand silent
and readily accepting
scribe student alike

fishes swimming slow
we can only guess as why
mysteriously

just before it hits
the plate reflects on thousands
of days of full life
