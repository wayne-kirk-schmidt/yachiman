breath. first small. then more.
then building then expanding
now filling sails and souls

wet globes splatter down
bitter salty crusting white
the color of grieving

oh the things I hope
you are well. you are happy.
even if you aren't

when I dream of snow
in the middle of summer
frigid flakes come now

each parting a pain
but are wonderful lessons
teaching me of life
