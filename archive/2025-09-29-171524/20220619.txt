laying my hand there
on a frightened bird to calm it
and then I wake up

souls newly minted
is that true? or better said
newly adopted?

what makes us ourselves?
first kiss? last meal? all our dreams?
all of that and more

aches and pains subside
after exertion building
something new to see

puppy and baby
joy in seeing each other
baby and kitten
