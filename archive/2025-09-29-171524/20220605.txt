points on a map
blackened rivers wiggling through
grey and white pages

and we match the spark
with heart worn fuel we care for
and watch the bonfire

yet all of our clocks
quietly tick to and fro
sounding forever

the woods were deep green
now filled with brown and orange
changing and falling

simple pearls shining
from the dirt we have brought in
and carefully built
