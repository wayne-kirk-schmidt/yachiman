tiger eyes gleaming
orange on yellow-orange
framed in the sunrise

abbot walks alone
staff jingling along the path
announcing dharma

the most special sweet
healing, comforting the soul
is true compassion

we put things to rest
and walk on in the jungles
allowing them to grow

under rich brown dirt
planted with prayers and care
are our hopes and dreams
