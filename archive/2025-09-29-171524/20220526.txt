and we step along
into the water and wind
blue white and grey mist

still red and orange
leaking slightly sweet juices
fruits in the morning

longer and thinner
the threads of our memory
woven into life

but can we locate
the bee, the ant, and inchworm
and tell them thank you?

finished during day
the meal is of fish and rice
white and grey filling
