slower and slower
red beats become blue whispers
and then memories

piano playing
stomping and crashing silence
surprisingly soft

presenting the dawn
in slivers glittering shards
of silver-grey light

simple pool of red
smearing with the thumb and hands
along the grey stone

simple fuzzy worms
move along the wet stone wall
droplets drying grey
