when we swim at night
we see ourselves looking when
when we swim at dawn

bring the oil and wheat
sharing and celebrating
bring the meat and fruit

the mountain stands proud
piercing the sky knowing well
even it will fade

gaps and chasms outline
lands and oceans also souls
navigate with care

the paper is gone
prayers lovingly burned away
and yet it remains
