watching ripples die
changing green-grey to blue white
as the seconds pass

orange to yellow
sunrise, bonfire, and sunset
showing a passage

dark clay bowls and cups
catching the needs of the day
fish, rice, and water

sleeping within snow
seeds dream of vibrant blossoms
waiting patiently

what the merchant knows
is the heart of the public
what the people want
