from the mountain edge
crisp air whips by the nostrils
waking us at dawn

written pages help
us navigate murky shores
of our memory

amazing we see
the future, present, and past
in each grain and drop

nuzzling close then
the puppy or kitten says
it is good to be

how does scripture start?
stories and notes then retold
catch celebration
