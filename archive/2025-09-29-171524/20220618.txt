blue-green shimmering
soft and wet excited by smells
snakes slither along

agreements brokered
be it fresh new or ancient
written in the clay

walking along red
religious and royalty
walking within blue

seek assurances
from the storm cloud and lightning
that will not yet come

push through the writing
finding the words and coaxing
them to a new home
