prelude ushers fugue
voices building melody
complementary

frogs sit in their ponds
enjoying standing water
dreaming of fat flies

green and purple mix
brown then oozing from the mix
aiding first brushstrokes

finest silver threads
holds jeweled beauty high above
over Damocles

Ishikawa sat
considering his prior meal
dark against the dawn
