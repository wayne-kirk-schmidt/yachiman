starting and ending
inching on the line slowly
a single worm smiles

relaxing at night
numbers dancing in my head
old friends help to sleep

repeating love songs
from the future to the past
repeating love signs

sitting by the edge
droplets drying in the sun
carrying something

when do you stop then?
when you say so? when others?
when life tells you so?
