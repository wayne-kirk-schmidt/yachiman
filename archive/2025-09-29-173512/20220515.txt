fearsome monsters come
birthed from our midday nightmares
welcomed as our friends

starting once starting again
putting black ink on paper
fulfills the practice

not all of the winds
are not harsh or cruel or cold
just gentle breezes

working with purpose
seeking food, seeking a home
see both large and small

cleaning the brushes
streaks from our last poetry
swirl black in water
