setting proud alone
floating high on water and dust
clay telling stories

teaching me lyrics
notes floating down and from you
swirling audio

simple truths sing
while normal days shout and yell
silence growls always

move pebbles away
and clean the stones white again
deposit prayers

there is elegance
marble and bronze cherry wood
technology art
