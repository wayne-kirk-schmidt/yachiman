softly whispering
the rain gently blesses us
promising us growth

cold can curse or bless
tearing at our fragile flesh
or gently cleanse us

water droplets falling
strike the forehead and shoulders
while we can stand still

simple flames enchant
dancing on matches and straw
promising of warmth

what calls us to serve?
gentle flutes or brash trumpets?
beautiful music
