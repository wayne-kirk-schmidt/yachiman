through the cloud cover
white plumes and grey whisps tickle
the nose and the lips

caps and mittens hide
the blue and white of chilled skin
within the snowstorm

within the fog lies
the ghosts of our minds waiting
to whisper softly

the first stroke is one
then next comes three also five
finally hundred

come from the heavens
carrying spears to the bridge
waters swirl to life
