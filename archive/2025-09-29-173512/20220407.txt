as the new day starts
shadows shorten, give way for
opportunity

the snail slowly moves
reveling in her white shell
just after the rain

Bertram bumblebee
carrying flowers pollen
blissful in purpose

the crumbling sand
starts out with just single grains
cascading further

as the water dries
in hallways and in driveways
summer memories
