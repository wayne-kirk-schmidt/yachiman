blue white streaking hot
falling into old warm earth
small meteor dies

sputtering lightly
seeping into the cuisine
butter explores food

once done with the fire
coals confident of their role
settle down to sleep

When you look at stars
winking, glittering at night
history dancing

I sit down and write
and tell of the day that passed
when we sit and read
