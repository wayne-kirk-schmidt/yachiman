looking at the moon
pale, pure, beautiful shining
from on our way home

circle to sliver
bouncing high and dipping low
stark and comforting

fishes idly push
through the waters and rivers
recalling ocean

the last spark floats up
gleaming then glowing then gone
ash floats as blessing

daily devotion
small acts and conversations
journal for heaven
