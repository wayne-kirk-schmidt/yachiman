gaze into the moon
see loving light streaming there
where does it come from?

small and thin sliver
changes and moves over time
become large and round

simple papers rest
on desks and bookshelves alike
wisdom brimming there

motion in flowers
pollen floating and moving
golden yellow snow

simple footsteps hide
within mud and snow and dust
pointing the way home
