silently singing
whispering chirps and warbles
birds in the morning

looking beyond me
to my future me and more
looking back at me

houses grey and black
waiting for new life hoping
for green and gold days

I now know who says
sunsets would be cold and wet
piercing the last clouds

package blue and white
sits primly on the table
ready for the night
