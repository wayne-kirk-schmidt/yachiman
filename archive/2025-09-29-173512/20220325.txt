dusting the walkways
memories and dreams float down
to be swept and used

walk with my heartache
clattering in the hallways
bones of yesterdays

dogs whimpering now
at noon peace and love reign but
dogs will howl at dawn

fishes gasp flopping
for help for prayers for life
on night decks of ships

dance on the wall top
gaze at green on either side
expecting the dawn
