try as we might then
tides then wash around castles
sand fleeing away

faraway the feather
floating downwards to faithful
a single white note

culture as compost
ancestors and grandparents
build and enrich us

gentle waves touching
toes and feet and legs washing
tears and memory

cards freely given
coming from the blind dealer
are they red or black?
