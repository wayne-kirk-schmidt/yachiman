moving in the mist
giant copper and steel whales
voices gurgling

and you told me once
while crying on my shoulder
though that stream has dried

lounging on the bed
looking fresh in afternoon
bathed in the warm rays

no we did not see
the start of the cometfall
we felt the impact

feet that do not touch
clay, rock, stream, ocean, and stone
move towards heaven
