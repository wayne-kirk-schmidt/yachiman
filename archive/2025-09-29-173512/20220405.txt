progress is achieved
very miniature changes
building to results

pouring ourselves in
to the oceans of our lives
blending with others

where we can speak up
shout out loudly and boldly
for those who cannot

I want to greet clouds
floating above the mountains
in the chilly dawn

when we are sleeping
recouping peace felt in youth
with each breath taken
