saved by your kindness
though was it intentional?
gratitude cares not.

movements are quiet
stepping through polished white stones
within dry rivers

clear your vision now
calm the heart and breathe deeply
what is left to see?

melody canters
prancing, charging joyfully
wrapping around us

thick dictionaries
contain yesteryears history
condensed languages
