waiting amidst rain
liquid snakes slithering
joyfully playing

turning old pages
enchanted by inkwise paths
making new pages

something new and rare
making the heart race and quake
found at the altar

walking through puddles
mirrors me looking at me
quivering brightly

for every day
review the prayer you say
whispered in morning
