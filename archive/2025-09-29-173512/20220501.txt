something tickles me
right within my memory
laughing and crying

blue boxes arranged
inside white with grey and gold
elegant remains

flowering yellow
hopeful, tentative, and young
breaks through the wet loam

when we know our mind
we see mirrors and mixtures
of the truth beneath

we can always change
to see something new and fresh
to pick a new path
