respect traditions
all the statues will tell you
whispers from the grave

white cloaks concealing
piety or devilment
depends on context

in fifty years time
what will become of us all?
the legacy of man?

briefly candles shine
beaconing to farthest shores
light bravely marching

before we began
at first was there a purpose?
my faith tells me yes
