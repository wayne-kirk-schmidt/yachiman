splatter noisily
drops bounce and wiggle in streams
cooling the summer

lush green and thriving
flowering and spreading far
reveling in life

spring echoes autumn
and summertime remembers snow
the year in mirrors

shards of memory
reflect lives of who we touch
and who we become

chalked in red and green
outlined in brown, blue and white
and each day redrawn
