what did she tell you?
that night, those days, all those years?
and did it linger?

special to the day
moving within grey silence
building foundations

from our very first
steps, laughter, tears, and wisdom
to our very last

beautiful pathways
whether cluttered or pristine
motion between us

why does the dog howl?
special mournful and hopeful
speak for the unseen
