once again the heart
heals holes erases divides
simply magical

rend the veil in two
throw wine and roses away
when the show completes

questions hang in air
full of curiosity
small grey cirrus clouds

washed away the dirt
from the old stones and iron
reveal the front door

step in deep puddles
hear the wall of water thunk
against the sidewalk
