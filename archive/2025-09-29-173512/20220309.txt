lines etched in the flesh
years lovingly carving paths
of experience

flexing the muscles
reveling in the motions
taking stock of me

hope always exists
balancing on futures edge
holding gloom at bay

adjust our burdens
shift from shoulder to shoulder
exploring our strengths

the prayer in silence
winging heavenward with speed
glistening white doves
