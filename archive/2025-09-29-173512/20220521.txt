at the first birth cry
something special moves within
celebrating life

and we eat our meal
rocking within the ocean
looking for our goal

stark white and regal
columns stand silent witness
to our history

holy walls and columns
celebrate our forgiveness
yet pocked with bullets

learn from our elders
learn from our current actions
to weave a future
