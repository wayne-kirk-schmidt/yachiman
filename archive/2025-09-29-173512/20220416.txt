stepping in the dust
swirling on the cold sidewalks
is what that remains

moths and cobwebs both
delight in flames drawn to light
consumed in a flash

when written in ink
nothing and circles teach us
about truth in all

memory quilted
by love, rage, sadness, and joy
each stitch is precious

one thread can sunder
three stand firmer while thousands
become tapestry
