twirling in my mind
globes spinning; showing new friends
who we never met

into memory
mixed in simple tranquil days
time thickly seasoned

did not choose this path
but walked along the roadway
live within the way

delicate roses
surging colors in morning
fading nightly blooms

gently rustling leaves
dancing with springtime gusting
fresh breezes warming
