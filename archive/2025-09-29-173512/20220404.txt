leap across water
daybreak visits us quickly
chasing yesterday

turtles and herons
idling on lakeside waters
basking in the sun

painted with brushes
poems and observations
joyful ink splashes

closing the letter
marking the edge in ochre
sent with calm purpose

making quiet meals
reflecting on the process
gentle activity
