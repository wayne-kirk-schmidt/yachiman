attaching the threads
of our lives to our dreams
both are used to weave

butterflies and moths
grow strong and tall dancing high
within the sunshine

fingers flexing straight
see the muscles and the scars
record of beauty

third and fifth combine
giving the sense of motion
a simple structure

simple notes streaking
racing to combine with grace
simple notes floating
