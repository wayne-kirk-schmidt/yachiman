revered wisdom sits
on the wet tip of the brush
waiting to be born

smallest snow-peaks wait
patiently white-blue for spring
to provide new springs

fine dust and rubble
sit at the base of proud walls
after language failed

look at the flower
serene in the simple field
awash with new life

cooked and dressed the meat
hangs on the wall dripping salt
ready to be cut
