so we move forward
looking up towards the summit
walking on our path

we speak of journeys
they contain starts and endings
and embody hope

the first apple seemed
delicious also fragrant
first in that garden

something should be said
first to you, then us, and all
discussing the tale

ancient bulls and gods
divine kings and queens reigning
painted from legends
