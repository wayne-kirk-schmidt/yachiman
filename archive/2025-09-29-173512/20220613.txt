knives slice the meat
carefully and lovingly
red rivulets flow

presenting the past
on white plates and silver bowls
rare delicacies

red claws and legs wave
motions on brilliant sands
blue tides washing in

simple and pristine
the wings of the moth flutter
brown then white then black

acrid tasting water
cupping tears of a lifetime
necessary grief
