beaches and a box
covered in the sand waiting
green tides to wash up

the monk moves quickly
over trail then over brush
quietly stepping

meals are held simply
thanks given within silence
brown, yellow, and white

we can guess the path
of love along the ridges
of our hearts and souls

it felt good to throw
single arc a silver ring
splash in dark water
