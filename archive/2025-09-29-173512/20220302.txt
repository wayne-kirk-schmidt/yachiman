present and accounted
within both my mind and heart
the message flutters

electricity
snakes along metal and bones
blessing and cursing

taste delicacies
savoring the simple tastes
touching the palate

somber grey grating
over silent cobblestones
as the horse moves on

sometimes when heaven
opens a sliver to see
we are warmed by bliss
