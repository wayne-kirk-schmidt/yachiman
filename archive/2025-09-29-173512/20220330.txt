and we come back now
to beginnings? or endings?
either way return

and we go on then
within our understanding
always stretching wings

can we make a home?
from the few twigs and branches
all things using love

we regard mirrors
helping our souls to focus
reflections of us

I think we can go
from this place to the next place
leaving memory
