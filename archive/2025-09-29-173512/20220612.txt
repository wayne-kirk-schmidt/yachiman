snakes slithering up
combining and frolicking
snakes slithering down

from the first writing
etched in clay and cut in bone
what really has changed?

when maps lie waiting
the very fabric changes
showing us visions

below the darkness
water so black it is blue
sleeps and waits our dreams

fired within a kiln
both letters and messages
waiting centuries
