it was the summer
witnessing raging deep greens
enjoy deep forests

decide and proceed
each day decisions face us
compounding our tasks

orange flutters bright
within white fields swaying slow
blossoms opening

grain yellow and brown
husks and sheaves and chaff remain
recycled again

just seconds before
the drop is perfectly round
plunge into water
