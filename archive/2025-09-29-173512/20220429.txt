fly over the webs
viewing milky death below
arachnid cuisine

clouds stretch over green
mixed like tea, steeped with water
providing delight

somehow we know it
that masses before and since
are with us today

what is right or left?
thin lines? viewpoints? something more?
daily decisions

first comes a rushing
then trickles then more rushing
the goal is a flow
