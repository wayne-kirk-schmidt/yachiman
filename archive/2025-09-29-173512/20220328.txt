what do we see here?
at the forest, edge gleaming
is it dawn or dusk?

the needle is thin
guiding dark thread through fabrics
building our clothing

muster the strength then
push against the oppressing stones
from others or us

shades of mist and smoke
blue green white grey repeating
are they real or no?

comfort or conceal
what is better? what is worse?
try all and then see
