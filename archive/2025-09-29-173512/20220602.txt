languages and tongues
blazing and sharp cutting cold
keep warmth away now

from the icicles
showering white frost downwards
we taste the first cold

fleeting clouds and sun
dance in blue, black, and grey sky
rain gently falling

after the windows shut
dust swirls and settles again
covering the glass

fragile white and blue
sitting on shelves and dreaming
of once grand parties
