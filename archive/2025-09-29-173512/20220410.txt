falling from heaven
white and blue and grey and green
spring weather colors

trees swaying in gusts
caught up in fresh cool breezes
hinting at summer

what could be made with
with our time and energy?
the fabrics of love

and I settle down
with books amidst the twilight
reading in shadow

water like fresh tears
cleans or etches based on
desires of our heart
