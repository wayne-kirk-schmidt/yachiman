gently wash the hands
proceeding with love and care
lily-white and blue

warm faces elegant
basking in the noontime sun
lightly sand dusted

springing into life
grains to sprouts then blossoming
a touch of water

trust and belonging
glittering jewels shine green
within the grey world

water touching heat
explodes with a hiss and scream
in the iron pan
