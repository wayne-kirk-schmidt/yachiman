make the heart in parts
grown neither fitted nor smoothed
but still beautiful

pattering down quickly
simple thirds and fifths playing
in the bright hallways

insistence captures
in the heart and in the hips
passing and longing

collecting raindrops
frigid yet liquid crusting
over sodden wood

ghosts walking the heart
do not wear sheets but our clothes
history covered
