rounding the corner
views slowing down to a crawl
magic of motion

offered in service
bread and wine to the faithful
which nurtures their faith

spreading wings to fly
the sparrow the eagle both
tense before leaping

pebbles skittering
on frozen water lightly
scratching the surface

our breath empowering
singing, praying, and speaking
special and quite rare
