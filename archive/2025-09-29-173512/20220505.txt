layers of life peel
away at the slightest touch
revealing our soul

reading the missive
given to us long before
yet relevant still

will conditions change?
people, family, countries?
for growth? always.

what would Moses say?
looking at the villages
where Kedua is

faith and science both
mirror and fuel each other
making each stronger
