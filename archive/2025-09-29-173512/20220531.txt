with red-blue mixing
purple flows and pools spreading
over white canvas

presenting the brush
flourishing red, blue, and grey
repainting morning

cold walls huddle high
assuring us the church stands
beckoning faithful

the first notes sound brash
only because the silence
had stood for so long

simple sand trembles
as the persistent bass calls
the dancing rhythm
