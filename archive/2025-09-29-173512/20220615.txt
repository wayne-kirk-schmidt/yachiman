pillars of water
turn to face the fearful flames
slowly become salt

drying on the shore
alive amidst fish and bones
looking at the gates

simple cuts and dents
lovingly claimed through the years
show a history

water if flowing
dancing lovingly slowing
water when resting

through a bronze needle
some thread slinking furtively
mends within silence
