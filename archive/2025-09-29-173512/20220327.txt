the shape of changes
mirror the shape of your heart
big or small by choice

closing on the goal
and veer off again and back
the way of learning

we build internal roads
reach to both love and caring
paved with our actions

in library books
wonderful worlds await us
when we read within

simple reds and blues
frame the temples and marking
sacred from profane
