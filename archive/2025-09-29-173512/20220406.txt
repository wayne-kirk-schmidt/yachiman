reverse the weakness
see how by walking backward
it becomes a strength

white feathers blessing
spread within churches and homes
a sign from heaven

small blocks turning up
to face the sunshine and rain
awash in sheer joy

If we were on mars
we look at the earth and moon
looking out and back

simplest grains simmer
within the soup building taste
for the meal tonight
