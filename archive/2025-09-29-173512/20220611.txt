from the black kettle
smoking blue and grey hissing
porridge is cooking

listen to the thrumming
pulses just below the skin
new life exploring

just in the moment
exploring the seeds and sprouts
bright islands of life

enshrined notation
expressing joy and sadness
theorems dancing

burning on the shore
seaweed and driftwood consumed
char and ash remain
