and yet we are here
pushing on with all our strength
against moving seas

pearls brilliant write
yet once were gnarled black soot beasts
and build up a shell

laughing and crying
both require some honesty
and some bravery

walking away from home
tears stinging from arguments
flick away in summer

shells within our shells
first child then youth thus adult
our past builds our now
