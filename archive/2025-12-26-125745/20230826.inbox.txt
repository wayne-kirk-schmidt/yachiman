summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through trees
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
oceans lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
still mist
clock lingers through moon
moon returns
