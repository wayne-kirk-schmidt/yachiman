pale fireplace
glass waits through fireplace
footsteps alone
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
Snow veils the bare road
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Care makes it strong now
