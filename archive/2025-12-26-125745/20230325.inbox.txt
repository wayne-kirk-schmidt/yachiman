cooked and dressed the meat
hangs on the wall dripping salt
to ready be cut
###
ears curving, bending
to music and to laughter
remember that tears
###
Summer rain begins
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm comes air to rest
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
never mind the dark
it is only that slim shadows
of what is real here
