summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
Sun warms the river
Mountains cut the clouds in halves
Eyes rest at last now
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
forests lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
