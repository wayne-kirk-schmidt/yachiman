pale late valley waits
silence drifts narrow breaks shore
late shadow folds pale
###
early heaven
bell holds through heaven
heaven breathing
###
deer lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
