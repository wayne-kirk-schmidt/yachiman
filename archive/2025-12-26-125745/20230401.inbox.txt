we cannot say now
which fullest path of passion
the drives heart forward
###
walk the with sand dunes
shifting, sliding as they do
moving in deserts
###
summer softly breathes
mist shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
mountains and deer
two cross currents in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
mountains drift shadows through footsteps
time pauses, listening
