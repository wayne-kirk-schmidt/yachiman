what a is haunting?
making us all catch our breath
in the evening
###
empty night
shore lingers through storms
afternoon unmoving
###
choosing to enjoy
each moment rich and second
plants peace and insight
###
regarding towers
defiantly claiming rights
albeit brief ones
###
rounding the corners
we speed and race through aiming
for a fleeting prize
