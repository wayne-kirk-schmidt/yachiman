sweetest tasting drinks
are small sips of cold water
after the day of work
###
strength in traditions
brown and faded, bright and new
patterns of belief
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind moves across open fields
The heat loosens grip
###
Evening meal is shared
Smoke trails into starry dim
Day letting go slowly now
