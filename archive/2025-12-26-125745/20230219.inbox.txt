dim path breaks wanders
storms folds warm glass still ember
faint distant narrow
###
wishing on future
effort, work, craft, and creation
building from the past
###
measuring heartbeats
precious and unique, sacred
empowering you
###
presenting darkness
receding in the bright dawn
illumination
###
spend the youth wisely
look for value and treasure
the time with others
