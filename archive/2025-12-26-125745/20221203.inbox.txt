Bright sun warms the stone
Mist drifts quiet along roads
Evening slowing down
###
afternoon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
rain upon stone steps
slick with the weight of the year
footsteps echo cancient
###
balloons lazily
dance across the noon skies
tracing out fresh joy
###
Too far or too few
balancing on pencils tip
words spring and move on
