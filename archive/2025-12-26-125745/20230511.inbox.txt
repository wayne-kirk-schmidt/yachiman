Warm air moves softly
Wind moves across open fields
Light grows soft again
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Heat presses down on the land
Evening slowing down
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Heat presses down on the land
Time eases its hold
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The heat loosens grip
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Fog drifts across the valley
Warm air comes to rest
