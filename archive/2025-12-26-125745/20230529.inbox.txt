Hot pavement steams now
Light shifts over the water
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm air moves softly
Wind moves across open fields
The long day slows down
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog drifts across the valley
Time eases its hold
###
Hot pavement steams now
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Warm air comes to rest
###
Soft mist lifts again
Fog drifts across the valley
Day slips into rest
