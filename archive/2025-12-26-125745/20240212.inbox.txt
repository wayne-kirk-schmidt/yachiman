wind folds cold opens
bare slow bare wanders circles
rises path settles
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
slow footsteps
ash waits through rain
footsteps alone
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
