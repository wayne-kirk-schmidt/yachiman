always let the stars
shine both on our brow and hearts
gently blessing them
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
sloshes water out
and spilling into the earth
as both food and fuel
###
From the hearth they rise,
spirals of forgotten flame,
fade into the sky.
