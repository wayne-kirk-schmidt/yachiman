path wave shore early
drifts warm quiet faint afternoon
drifts fades narrow
###
River flows gently,
Surging past rocks with a splash,
Summer sun warms all,
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
