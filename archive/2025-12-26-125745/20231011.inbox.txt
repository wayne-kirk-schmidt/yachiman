silence wave valley
wind faint cold footprint still bare
holds heavy distant
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through trees
time pauses, listening
###
faint afternoon
shadow leans through afternoon
afternoon at rest
###
new years lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
