I cannot fathom
spiritual worlds in worlds
faith should be simple
###
staring at the beams
moved into place long ago
pleasant musty smells
###
summer breathes softly
shadows spring drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
