summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
sun lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns that page
###
hawks fly silently
gliding through the air at dawn
looking piercingly
###
sleep lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
