summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
faint distant rain slips
drifts passes rises late stone
warm opens path leans
###
drifts heavy late ridge
snow still lingers late distant
path lantern wanders
###
narrow fall
iron opens through windows
winter alone
