stone opens dim night
warm soft breaks holds path lantern
breaks bare lingers cold
###
River's soft embrace
Surging waves splash upon smooth rocks
Summer's calm delight
###
children chase the waves
feet soaked with sudden laughter
ocean pulls them back
###
but we know the start
with breathing in and out life
pulsing to heartbeats
###
late signal signal
still holds wind drifts early path
drifts distant distant
