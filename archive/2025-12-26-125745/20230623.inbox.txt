Gray stone holds the cold
Stone remembers falling snow
Faith stays unbroken
###
Cold water on stone
Water carries old prayers
Stillness endures
###
Frozen river bends
God listens without reply
Silence answers back
###
Stone river in frost
Cold hands touch running water
Winter does not speak
###
God walks winter paths
Water carries old prayers
Silence answers back
