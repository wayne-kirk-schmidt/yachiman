Green fields drink the rain
Wind moves across open fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
could we have seen this?
nature itself is silent
except to then roar
###
what is in the depth
of my description of love?
heart beating louder
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
slow otera
ash waits through oceans
oceans alone
