summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through rivers
time pauses, listening

summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
bare forests
stone folds through forests
forests unmoving
###
otera (buddhist temple) and footsteps
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
cold cold still still wind
shore slides dim waits silence
water leaf settles
