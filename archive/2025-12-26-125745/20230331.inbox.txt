blue white streaking hot
falling into old warm earth
small meteor dies
###
Bright warms sun the stone
Wind moves across open fields
Evening slowing down
###
laying my head flat
listening to our heartbeats
calms the restless soul
###
I want to see it
the clear lining on the clouds
bringing us new hope
###
walking the circle
smaller slices move closer
towards the center
