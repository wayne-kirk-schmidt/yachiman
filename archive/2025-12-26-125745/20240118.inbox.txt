empty otera
ridge folds through otera
otera at rest
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
opens ridge slow stone
ember closes valley cold
breaks silence heavy
###
dawn lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
distant breaks glass late
soft echo glass wanders waits
ember faint lingers
