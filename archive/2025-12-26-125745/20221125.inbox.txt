moving more than Mach
small objects with purposes
within the night sky
###
we can approach them
standing on shores in smooth sand
the sun shining high
###
still path rises soft
shore glass wind path ridge valley
still opens valley
###
song sung at morning
rings through the soul during day
and, at night, felt still
###
look at the islands
ask yourself are they for me?
beauty singular
