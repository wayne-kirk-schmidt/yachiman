summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
Grandparents smile slow
Trees creak like doors in the wind
Clouds pass below us
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
narrow spiders
valley leans through spring
spring unmoving
