closes breaks footprint
holds waits glass lantern lingers
late wind lantern cold
###
silence wave valley
wind faint cold footprint still bare
holds heavy distant
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
Stone river in frost
God listens without reply
Faith stays unbroken
###
on the desert edge
and lizards mice frolicking
fine little motion
