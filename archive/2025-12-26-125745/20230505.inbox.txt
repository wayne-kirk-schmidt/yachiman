Summer rain begins
Rain moves across still water
Evening slowing down
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Fog drifts across the valley
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Green fields drink the rain
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Heat starts to drift off
###
Summer rain begins
Rain moves across still water
Heat starts to drift off
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Time eases its hold
