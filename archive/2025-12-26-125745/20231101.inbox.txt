Ghosts wait in hallways
Mountains cut the clouds in halves
Voices come home now
###
ember wave slides
ember slow path signal snow
circles shadow dim
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
