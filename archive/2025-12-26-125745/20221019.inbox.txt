tenderly we touch
gently we create ideas
blooming into now
###
I can see the rain
moving in great and sheets bursts
washing away pain
###
River's calm embrace
Surging waves splash on warm rocks
Summer glistens light
###
sweat drips and then falls
marking exertion with grace
honoring that work
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through new years
time listening pauses,
