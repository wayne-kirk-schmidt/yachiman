new cuts now healing
walking within future and past
building memory
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows through drift night
time pauses, listening
###
bare morning
shore closes through morning
morning unmoving
###
dust clings to our feet
from path the we took and take
silent testament
###
Hot pavement steams now
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
nothing in the hall
catches the weight of silence
or sees the shadows
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows through drift jinja
time pauses, listening
###
Green fields drink the rain
Wind moves across open fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
slipping through our hands
sands moves and flows as it must
dreams hiding within
###
water dries on that floor
as bathwater drains away slow
offering new hope
###
splendidly shining
the skull glitters from the loam
telling great stories
###
small and thin sliver
changes and moves over time
become large and round
###
fades late soft leaf
shore shore soft heavy slow path
closes early slips
###
walking in silence
teaches the heart to be calm
beating in silence
###
Cold prayer in winter
Cancient hands touch running water
Water keeps its way
###
storm clouds gather quick
folding shadows over fields
lightning waits its turn
###
we put things to rest
and walk on in the jungles
allowing them to grow
###
pattering down quickly
simple thirds and fifths playing
in the bright hallways
###
Thunder in the hills,
rain hurries across the fields,
cattle rush for home.
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
sloshes water out
and spilling into the earth
as both food and fuel
###
harsh light and crisp air
the framing budding morning
possibilities
###
narrow quiet holds soft
rises holds signal closes
glass distant breaks bare
###
polish the mirror
set into the sky giving
the moon and the stars
###
pale doors
light fades through spiders
spiders breathing
###
breathes summer softly
night shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
soft fades lantern
shadow rises holds snow still
lingers leans silence
###
Summer solstice burns
Sun climbs over frost and mud
Stars begin twice now
###
as we regard blood
within us and among us
binding and flowing
###
divining portents
coming from the horizon
as stars start to fall
###
quickly the heart heals
forgetting the agony
letting ache subside
###
Summer rain begins
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm comes air to rest
###
trust and belonging
glittering jewels shine green
within the grey world
###
quiet ember slow dim
empty holds empty sun slips
lingers slips dim leans
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
look we for meaning
in morning, in evening
in the frosted pane
###
slips water lingers
bare path silence distant path
shore lingers footprint
###
pole each at each end
guides the fields and the currents
ferrying charges
###
move pebbles away
and clean the stones white again
deposit prayers
###
spiders narrow
valley leans through spring
spring unmoving
###
I did not know it
the time when you said goodbye
I but felt it pass
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
a laugh never heard
springs from the mouth of a child
echoes bloom song like
###
laying my head flat
listening to our heartbeats
calms the restless soul
###
distant beach
ember circles through beach
beach at rest
###
breathes summer softly
forests shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through heaven
time listening pauses,
###
will I pursue me
finding capability
and celebrate it
###
the horizon sits
in judgement on the present
witness to the past
###
rain Summer begins
Fog drifts across the valley
The night comes in slow
###
rivers lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
through the cloud cover
white plumes and grey whisps tickle
the nose and the lips
###
the ancient trees sway
with knowledge of the wood green
wild and powerful
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
Birds rise at sunrise
Boulders warm under noon sun
Water keeps pace now
###
stone opens dim night
warm soft breaks holds path lantern
breaks bare lingers cold
###
of the thirteen
whose souls spans across ages
simple true mirrors
###
melismatic sounds
snake up and harmonies down
speaking to heaven
###
I am a tadpole
Exclaimed youth darting around
And soon will be more
###
steel alternating
between strength and supple form
built upon each stroke
###
tissues are ripped
and knit, reripped and reknit
layered endurance
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
Snow veils the bare road
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Care makes it strong now
###
breath. first small. then more.
then building then expanding
now filling sails and souls
###
thinking in pictures
speaking to allegories
embracing world the
###
logic and reason
then merged with humility
can complement faith
###
Warm air moves softly
Heat presses down on the land
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Winter water flows
Gray clouds press on still rivers
endures Stillness
###
at last the nighttime
lay my head down and reflect
on previous day
###
