empty waits leans beach
distant faint shadow holds drifts
closes bare soft leaf
###
distant wave footprint
bare ember breaks circles glass
path leaf drifts lingers
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through spring
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through fall
time pauses, listening
