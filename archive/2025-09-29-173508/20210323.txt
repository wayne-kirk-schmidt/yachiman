what was that secret?
the one we shared long ago
now faded in time?

the second hand creeps
minute hands running dancing
with blurred faces

above the crow caw
deep in the crisp morning air
jeweled dew hanging

she turns away now
life lived fully, with goodbyes
not sad but with pride

smallest feet wiggle
eyes squinting with fresh purpose
drinking in color
