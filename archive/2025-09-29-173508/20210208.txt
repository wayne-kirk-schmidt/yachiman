storms rage against land
tearing furiously blindly
force that dissipates

quiet the mind for now
focus on the new silent
weight leaves the new heart

I polish a stone
glittering with joy and glee
neighbors wait their turn

eaten meal long gone
revisiting the flavours
that walk with me now

seeking sun's new rays
visiting the moon's crescent
the song of day change
