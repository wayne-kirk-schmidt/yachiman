turtle shells hide well
gentle strength and measured wit
they have to give us

one word cuts deeply
is it word or emotion?
or our fear of them?

build me a castle
within my heart lined with strength
and festooned with age

cornering anger
washing away passions dust
show caring beneath

when we tell ourselves
survive then revive then thrive
quickening begins
