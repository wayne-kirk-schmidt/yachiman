this is the message
written and sent long ago
for people unseen

what is a purpose?
something compelling or more?
fashion or guidepost?

bracketing my words
visions of you and your heart
shaping delivery

the room dark and cold
feeble glows outlining tears
after the argument

travel changes us
bonds souls and merges ideas
feeds
