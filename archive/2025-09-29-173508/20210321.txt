bridges span countries
in our minds and our countries
helping us connect

joining in friendship
little hands and feet linked now
building hearts and minds

from clay baked for kings
to technology wonders
teach us just the same

salamander smiles
eyes twinkling brightly green
happily wiggling

from the blood of grapes
and gently baked in the sun
communion comes
