Speeding along roads
Solid white unbreakable
guards as well as guides

yet what can ye keep
proclaim the tombstone writing
written in promise

memento mori
sobering yet strangely calm
reflects our image

with pallettes of love
painting oceans with our joy
sketching the heavens

moving two four eight
eyes wondering to knowing
children grow so fast
