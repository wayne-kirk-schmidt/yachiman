sadness first removed
rubbish cleaned and walls well scrubbed
the hearth is ready

when we burn with love
do flames reach up to heaven
so angels can see?

sunset comes gently
and closes the accounting
the day can now sleep

viewing souls afar
must seem like firelight dancing
shining for us all

while we eat and drink
following transformation
life to death to life
