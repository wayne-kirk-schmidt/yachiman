fluttering notes sing
climbing and falling octaves
delivering joy

compositions are
words, pictures, sounds, and action
balancing beauty

praise yet critique well
trained eyes lathe final results
honing the impact

what is it to code?
collect, order, do, evolve
elegant purpose

within my reading
challenge my mind asking for
imagination
