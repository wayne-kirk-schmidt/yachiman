where angel meets ape
fingers brush past in motion
with hope and knowing

fiery forges
blend alloys of emotions
always spitting sparks

quench blazing iron
hiss! the muted scream complains
transforms into peace

clean and sinuous
slithering along anvils
metals coil and bend

clang! on one three count
striking to place and to shape
purpose from raw form
