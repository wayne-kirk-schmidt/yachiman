First touch nervously
valentine blossoms building
promise future love

master zhao tells us
water enjoys many lives
steam flow dew ice still

snow lying in drifts
richly promise cold wonders
step into beauty

bath water steaming
calming soothing at days end
islands of comfort

asking our questions
of others and of ourselves
seeking new answers
