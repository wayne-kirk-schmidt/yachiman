built up from nothing
towering above the world
returning to dust

described by ancients
compare glory and wonder
Babylon gardens

towers and high spires
castles of my mind sprawling
in perfect wonder

Sisyphus moving
up and down yet his boulder
ends up no further

seraphim angels
flank the wood and golden box
famous mercy seat
