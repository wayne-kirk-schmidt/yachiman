No! never again!
But as the Ferris wheel rises
The excitement builds

crossing the rivers
jumping over ponds and lakes
pure air cold and sweet

simple meals for monks
truth, love, devotion, caring
spiritual fill

pure notes descending
from heavens gates to our ears
if we can listen

kings and ministers
queens also ambassadors
who will guide their hands
