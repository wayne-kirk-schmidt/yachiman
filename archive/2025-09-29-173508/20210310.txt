Manufactured sounds
slithering strange melodies
unsettling us

I cannot tell you
if the reaches of the sea
starts or ends with tears

masks cover faces
and summon the deep spirits
in wooden echoes

as the smallest mouse
moves with curiosity
and tiny beauty

cheerleading progress
tasks for teachers or leaders
and not pearls for swine
