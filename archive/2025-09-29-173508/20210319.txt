beauty of decay
fragments swirl in the soft wind
teasing the mind's edges

Noah released two birds
first the raven and the dove
each with a mission

monkeys within us
angels floating above us
touching just briefly

within a minor key
glimpsing crying sanctified
keen with simple grace

music can puncture
the greyest cold silences
dispelling sorrow
