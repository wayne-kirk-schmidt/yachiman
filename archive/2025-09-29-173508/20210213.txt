brick breaks into dust
swirling around the corners
of great feats long gone

boiling in my soup
fish broth with vegetables
simmering with taste

a tiny hand flexing
reaching for a connection
from child to parent

smells remain in air
reminding of what has been
afterimages

homes bear the years well
structure accumulating
in silent witness
