eyes set far apart
watching each side of the world
but will the sides meet?

within high mountains
surrounded with countryside
krishna greets pilgrims

heaving seas surging
stragglers hurrying inside
starting forty days

swordsmiths know along
contained within bright beauty
cold deadly purpose

mouths open and shut
flanking the holy entrance
joining to say aum
