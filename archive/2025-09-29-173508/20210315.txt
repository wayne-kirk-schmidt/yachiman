present and pushing
sweating and struggling now
within our own mind

define it to be
the thing we need and look for
love and tenderness

rules defined by those
others who came before us
support and protect

what is buddha soul?
a glimpse of all the children?
joyful sound of play

dinner of the soul
feasting on experience
seasoned with wisdom
