lordship of the trees
living life full of purpose
defiant to the world

sharp edges gleaming
show single deadly purpose
yet crowned in beauty

approaching slowly
hunter and prey moving linked
with pending purpose

utter it and weep
the secret word to unmake
changes both and all

words across the room
long ago and far away
forgiven and gone
