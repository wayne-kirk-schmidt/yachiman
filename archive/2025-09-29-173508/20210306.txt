statues standing guard
serene and composed in white
holding sacred notes

lakes containing fish
water laps around  the boat
inside Gallilee

I accept your zen
fully complete without flaw
taught from mastery

we move through clock ticks
days months years flowing building
a river of life

black white mix to grey
though blunting distinction yet
building subtlety
