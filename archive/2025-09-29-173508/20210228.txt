small feet unsteady
stumbling, walking, then running
as the years move by

if I told you now
all the love within my heart
to start takes an age

shout out all the names!
of those who passed before us
who deserve our thanks

what do we all fear?
pain? calamity? something more?
or just simply change?

twenty years ago look
on now with excitement and
the far past with love
