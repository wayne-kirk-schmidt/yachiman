red purple blue white
color riots blossoming
fading with the wind

special words can heal
spoken delivered with care
I forgive you now

what can we see then?
staring at the grey shorelines
glimmers of morning

For I am a cat
and walk through life as cats do
curiously so

from the depths hidden
from tidal pools and beyond
new life rejoices
