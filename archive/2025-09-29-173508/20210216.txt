what is in the depth
of my description of love?
heart beating louder

green pasture rolling
under sleepy sunny skies
littered with white sheep

old denim and shoes
clacking across hard wood floors
grandpa comes back home

wishing for rain clouds
washing the mud and fatigue
refreshing the land

ferry star gazing
whisper black harbor beckons
asking you to dream
