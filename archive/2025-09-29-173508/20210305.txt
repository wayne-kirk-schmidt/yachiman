grains whistling along
passing by dunes and valleys
remains of an age

present the choices
daily paths to take and try
filled with new joy

morning cereal
stares at me waiting for spoons
a daily ritual

investing our youth
what treasure did you obtain?
Wisdom, Love, or Strength?

staring with glasses
from a dimly lit mirror
reflection smiling
