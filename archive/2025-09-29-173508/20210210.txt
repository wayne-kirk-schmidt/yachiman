sepia spreads from secrets
coloring conversations
indistinctly grey

animals moving
bound up behind clearest glass
who is in a cage?

zen presents itself
within the seed, grain and stalk
ground accepts them all

building word castles
from nouns, verbs, and adjectives
strength within speeches

spider tests web silk
builds and weaves both home and traps
yet looks all the same
