within our own flesh
structures of bone and muscle
cooperating.

could we choose our fate?
instead, act out in a play?
choice always echos

what we must and should
times at odds with needs and wants
the price of twin goals

bathing in water
trickling down freshly clean skin
cleaning away doubt

frigid winds subside
blossoms muster strength to bask
in the sun in spring
