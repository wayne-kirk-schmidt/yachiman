sounding out sorrow
separating the small sobs
from the large wailing

two minds contending
in a room maneuvering
intimate discourse

the page reflects back
what hopeful hearts and minds want
something comes from void

We will push on more
said the captain of the soul
leading us onward

dunes shift and waver
following the winds bidding
remembering home
