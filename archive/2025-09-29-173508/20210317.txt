twelve beans arranged
across  heaven's long table
a soup for all months

may it be always
the pain and bruises fading
love and wisdom stay

curiosity
pushes, drives, compels, rewards
those who live by it

can a box hold light?
can the sea eat a desert?
mystery lessons

cup enlightenment
wet the soul with those waters
and watch
