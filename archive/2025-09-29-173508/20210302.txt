sovereign powers
setting the stage in a play
watching pawns with glee

Turning my gaze too late
Glimpsing the sad frail motions
I must respond now

circling high above
hawk wings delight in the speed
basking in the sun

eight keen points of view
watching the ends of the web
for new intruders

what could we say now?
to patch the wounds in the heart?
soft words are failing
