begin here with one
small seeds planted in the dirt
yet speaks of great trees

move through a meadow
green bleeding into the sky
summer dazzles us

Can I count them now?
all the sands in my hourglass
instead, let them flow

succulent dishes
lure us to evening meals
spent with family

Do not speak! Silence!
Seen on stern granite faces
guarding the ages
