two hundred pilgrims
stride from dark to open day
leading followers

seven times around
pausing to reflect on faith
single noble square

five worldly corners
lend strength in pillars to build
the steps to the gods

demons and angels
struggle against each other
sides of the same coin

boulder pushed aside
with the chamber empty now
on that first morning
