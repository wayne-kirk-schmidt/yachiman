wisps of air inflate
hopes and dreams making way for
actions and milestones

run on! run further!
coach says pushing the pupil
stretching what can be

familiar aching
mental and physical pains
can signal our growth

you must remember!
says the line of ghosts onshore
as the waves recede

perfect and healthy
in tasting the fruits explode
naturally sweet
