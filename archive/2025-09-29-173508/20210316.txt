go past tired bodies
push forward into the grey
sleep will come later

captured in moments
tears and laughter blending now
a bittersweet drink

what would you trade now?
riches or power or more?
or would you just be?

dark and light defined
shadows providing shelter
helping to survive

all steps are first ones
all discoveries are new
all stories are told
