Silent in water
Surging from cliffs and dark pools
our Life moves and thrives

Koans step forward
Single sentences jar us
Slicing through untruths

from dark gazing out
eyes struggling shifting sight
beholding the light

what keeps us right here?
what bonds tie invisibly?
what image remains?

Circle within page
moving from top and again
Celebrating void
