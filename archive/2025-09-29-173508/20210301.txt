pushed through the cobwebs
memories spun and woven
building the stories

fragile boards support
planking across dark deep chasms
yet we dare to cross

compels us further
to do acts of great kindness
simple empathy

cellos soft singing
notes that slip from ear to heart
gently walking on

grey mornings hold us
last bonds to we the living
gently cradling souls
