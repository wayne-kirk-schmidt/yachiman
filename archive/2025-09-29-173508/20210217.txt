Can you believe it?
the best and worst of the world
contained in our words

watching that water
can freeze in midair falling
into frigid mist

goldilocks moments
shelter the earth from ruin
smallest of degrees

encouragement builds
confidence and trust using
words well placed with care

empires wax and wane
small beacons of light blazing
for a few scant days
