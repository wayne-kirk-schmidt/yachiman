flames dance up and down
heat caressing and warming
the wood as it dies

dust lies in the hall
comfortable and serene
the remnants of skin

read through the paper
avoiding fear marketplaces
look for hopeful truth

drinking clear water
nothing within but itself
the taste is so sweet

chopsticks blur today
seeking rice, fish and garnish
simple meals delight
