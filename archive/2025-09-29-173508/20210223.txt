skipping on water
the stone speeds along bouncing
one five seven gone

eyes red with old tears
gaze up daring a response
too late in the day

present and silent
the sitting monk gazes through
from earth to heaven

the clamor of pain
sudden and swift and savage
choir of sensation

holding onto mist
frigid hands at dawn slipping
flowing memories
