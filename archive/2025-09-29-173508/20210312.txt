purpose springing fresh
marking souls with direction
compass guiding on

Stay. Here in the place
where the heart is. where minds seek.
in mental temples

presenting myself
without disguise without guile
looking for you too

seconds before flame
prior to the spark and hiss
the match quickly springs

pushing against walls
cementing us holding us
smash fear into hope
