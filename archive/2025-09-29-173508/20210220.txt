salt also pepper
adds seasoning to a beard
maturing with age

left and right footsteps
both move half-moons circling
dancing mandalas

Anticipation
single droplets descending
just prior to the storm

one three five seven
continuing on and on
still oddly perfect

what could you tell me
of the white robes at the wall
praying at sunset
