awoke into life
earthquakes of the heart jolt us
past the past losses

share the supper plate
filled to bursting our dreams
a feast for the mind

balloons lazily
dance across the noon skies
tracing out fresh joy

turtles slowly blink
seeing past shallow shorelines
longing for deep seas

Blossoms withering
hanging then dropping from vines
making way for growth
