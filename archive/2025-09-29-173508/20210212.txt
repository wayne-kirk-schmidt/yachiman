major and minor
steps along a signature
melody moving

falling from branches
inflame imagination
apples speed along

time pulls on my heart
bringing waves of memory
joy mixed with pain

grey abounds outside
and holds up sunrises till
reds and golds blossom

what if we can still
listen to silent voices
speak of memories
