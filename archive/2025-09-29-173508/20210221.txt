Demonstrating love
within gestures and phrases
small and beautiful

blossoming colors
swirling around and mixing
within the meadow

what could be done now
when the water spills outside
from broken pitchers

we cannot say now
which fullest path of passion
drives the heart forward

spoon and forks and knives
approach our meals with pleasure
partaking with joy
