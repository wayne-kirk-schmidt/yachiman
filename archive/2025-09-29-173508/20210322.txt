running into wind
merging the past and future
as we keep moving

we eat to survive
ready waiting for a meal
looking and looked at

hands from centuries
litter the walls of dark caves
lending our support

spent and wobbly
the runner walks and cools down
planning the next race

decorating love
with red flowers and kisses
present our passion
