At the day's ending
facing thoughts mirrored dimly
in memory's glass

droplets on the wood
sluggish in the afternoon
sap flowing sadly

the masks are in place
and have been over the years
will we take them off?

when the book is read
linger over light grammar
while skimming dark prose

nothing I see now
compares to view of the hill
nor will it ever
