making a mark here
printing on a heart and soul
always moving on

standing reflecting
the afternoon light dazzles
from the tall buildings

columns and stele
proclaiming and announcing
crumble and then fall

striding between words
what I speak and what I know
meaning gushes through

simple viewing helps
the mind and heart to explore
whets our tastes for more
