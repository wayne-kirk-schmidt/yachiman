gusts of wind whisper
around cracks in the doorway
we were born to roam

nevertheless, we walk
through the wind and fire and rain
enjoying the road

that can be the way
life secrets as simple as
treat all with caring

standing on the wall
looking from one side and on
reflected in green

memory is not pure
it changes with and molds us
a great catalyst
