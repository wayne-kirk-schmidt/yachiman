the package is sent
when it arrives what happens?
accepted or not?

bicycle resting
against a tree quietly
waiting for purpose

when the dog grows old
and dreams of youth and puppies
the tail wags slightly

we can approach them
standing on shores in smooth sand
the sun shining high

I must try to bear it
the not knowing the waiting
for growth to occur
