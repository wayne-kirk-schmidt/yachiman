they are rushing now
breathing hard and soaked in sweat
our dreams and our work

I know my limits
what I should and must not do
and when to break them

of course, i can fly
across pages and over problems
as the mind nimbly moves

each page can present
the thrill of love in days past
bringing us along

now I shut the book
and put my head down to sleep
till our next day comes
