bridging the paper
to letters to words to worlds
vital noble tasks

lie back and relax
enjoy warm water flowing
roiling steam clouds

but what should we say
to the ghosts of never been?
to reflect our love?

within the hallway
doors surrounding us saying
"choose. you have a right"

one the door opens
the past hall darkens and dims
light beckons onwards
