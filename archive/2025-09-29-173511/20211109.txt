find a way to live
within moments outside time
accomplishing this

as the clock creeps to
midnight and expresses loss
what do we hear then?

generations rush
moving at the speed of life
finding completion

descending downward
fireballs breaking off streaking
aiming for the sea

with stark white dishes
meals are eaten in silence
our repast alone
