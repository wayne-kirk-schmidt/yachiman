who you will protect
speaks volumes on who you are
thus choose wisely then

cloud cover coming
across the mountains speeding
descending into night

speaking in whispers
lingering in blue hallways
touching hearts and minds

first steps to wisdom
are simple and astounding
and always humbling

read the book of days
recording our decisions
as they help us grow
