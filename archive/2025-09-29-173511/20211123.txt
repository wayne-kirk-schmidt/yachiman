shuffling papers
sifting prior messages
from a prior age

anticipation
waiting for the door to move
in the still old house

outlines in old stone
jutting above the shoreline
wait for the return

we approach our day
coming into that race gate
waiting to begin

set down the brushes
messages have been written
now to have them read
