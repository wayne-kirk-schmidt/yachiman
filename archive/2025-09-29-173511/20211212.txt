around the day star
circling keeping exact time
dancing along space

sample a soup made now
from vegetables and broth
made with care and joy

to practice design
is a discovery path
alloying new themes

something magical
about the dawn, noon, and night
synchronized motion

thinking in pictures
speaking to allegories
embracing the world
