exploring the dirt
finding loam, rocks, and pebbles
as we build castles

weaving tonal webs
the best of them talk to us
with the strings they make

squinting in sunset
looking for the small black dot
and yet white returns

once the waters ebb
and drain amidst the wreckage
the rainbow appears

was it a gift then?
burdened to faithfully act?
and then to rebuild?
