now we grow larger
building on our time well spent
into the next phase

what do we learn then?
from failure and with success?
balanced perspective

A man slowly smiles
and regards the earth he worked
noting the changes

My great aunt worked clay
with passion and joyful skill
making new marvels

When you hear at last
the words you long to receive
does that fulfill you?
