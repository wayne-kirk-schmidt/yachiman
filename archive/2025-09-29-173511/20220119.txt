marching silently
small black specks purposefully
go far from their home

regarding silence
special hooks that open you
exposing the heart

between finger clasps
the first grasp saying "hello!"
smaller to larger

feet find the flooring
totter for seconds then walk
quickly learning more

I could have not wished
to live a more joyful life
than the one I have
