when words are written
taking shape and living in
imagination

ancient grey forests
stirring with a newfound grace
stately hallmarks move

what does silence see?
within whispery shadows?
pageantry of mime

fingers flex and curl
reaching around my left thumb
as she finds my hands

there are dim echoes
enough to see past and now
moving in today
