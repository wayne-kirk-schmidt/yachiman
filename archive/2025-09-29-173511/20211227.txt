Hold our vows up close
Examining reflecting
On how far they reach

Bobbing on the sea
Against light and dark patches
From clouds dissolving

The weighing of sides
The groan of the doubt and sin
Is nothing to God

Once we stopped the clock
Marveling at the minute
That could have become

The path of the just
Within golden silver rules
Guiding charity
