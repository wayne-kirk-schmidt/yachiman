listen to the spring
bubbling, gushing, silent
yet always moving

touching at the heart
words and deeds draw diagrams
to help also guide

waving to the shore
in boats which move to and fro
which waves back also

present arguments
convincing explanations
illustrate your soul

radio bathes us
carrying our messages
also moving on
