walkways here are bright
shining with warm sunlight
within newfound joy

sweeping our pebbles
into streams and swirling curves
we organize us

I say; tell it now
say the truth and speak plainly
build on that strong bridge

waves approach and crash
linger wistfully and return
back into the deep

beauty abounding
serendipitously found
fostering wonder
