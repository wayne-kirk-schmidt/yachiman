walking through winter
watching the snow drifting down
and then melt away

white has shades and hues
the purest containing sky
then blue and others

icy and sliding
down the walkways also stairs
in the morning sun

spidery ice cracks
water gushing out 'it's cold!'
from the creaking lake

whispers of heat waft
from cold fingers winding down
and along the wind
