once we have started
we cannot should not will not
slow down our progress

this is a first then
working towards the goal now
the end drawing close

not that we can see
but our heartbeat can sense it
love as it blossoms

can we finish this?
the sentence and paragraph?
do not hesitate

words are flighty things
they squeak and flutter and flit
around all of us
