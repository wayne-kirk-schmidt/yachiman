seasonal spirits
overflowing the heart and soul
instead of your cup

in the deepest woods
dancing and twirling at dawn
scattering cold leaves

long ways to go now
through the night along the road
stretch into  darkness

steady the sails now
facing the heaving green seas
spread with icy snow

spring echoes across
summer and autumn landing
in a wintry ear
