we start again then
working on understanding
as we grow and learn

walking through deep fog
struggling to remember it
vision of mercy

within these four halls
choosing the right direction
changes day by day

so that I will know
saying secret words daily
building memory

when laid bare and clean
from grit from lies from the past
passions shine purely
