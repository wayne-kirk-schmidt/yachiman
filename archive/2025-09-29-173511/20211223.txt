what will continue?
long after written word fades
from all the pages

my voice faltering
as I sing about home I knew
and will return to

and the carpenter
examines the beams before
making the first cut

could we sing out loud?
purest notes and best chorals?
in celebration

noting the blotting
of ink on the page drying
becoming a fact
