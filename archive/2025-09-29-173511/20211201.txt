you come into here
assuming nothing looking
for your future self

dancing grasshoppers
before the sea or near flames
pictures of beauty

picture this for me
no fences because no need
yet respecting all

not that we see it
but rather chatter we hear
events excite us

with each day we grow
into trees? bushes? flowers?
something we can choose
