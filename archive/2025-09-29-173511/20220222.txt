what I swore to do
to heaven so long ago
defines me today

steel alternating
between strength and supple form
built upon each stroke

walking the mountain
chasing paths following dusk
exploring wonder

what was the lesson?
humility? gratitude?
woven in our lives

walking through the house
wee winking houselight fireflies
guiding to bedtime
