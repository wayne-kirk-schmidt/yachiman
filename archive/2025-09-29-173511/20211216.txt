special flowers bloom
in deserts also at night
determination

inventing the world
one truth told at a time
a good way to go

wanting the world
only increases wanting
neglecting key things

paint the first totem
stain and carve the rest of them
to protect us all

innocence first glance
a child looking at the world
along with parents
