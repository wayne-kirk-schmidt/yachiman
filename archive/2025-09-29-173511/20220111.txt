four thousand weeks pass
with purpose and quiet grace
celebrating life

counting the seconds
quickens the heart as we wait
excitedly now

hours singing deep notes
while seconds warbling rush
through great seas of years

commit memory
recalling basic lessons
understanding grows

following rules
extending and exploring
thus making new ones
