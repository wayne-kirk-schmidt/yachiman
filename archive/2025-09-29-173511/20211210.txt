walking down the lane
memories blooming in full
towards the future

capturing the taste
of love and longing at dawn
savour bittersweet

glimpsing the deep look
in your eye when we first kissed
covering shadows

choose to love always
seek blessing, healing, and hope
a daily prayer

finally complete
a new bridge at first shaky
strengthening with time
