from the sunset edge
we can see the line of dusk
speeding on alone

replace my true face
fast one after another
till ewhat does remain?

mold the raw metal
warming, caressing with heat
into new a life

move the clock hands on
Across the dusty dark face
Try to reclaim then

Piano waiting
For hands to caress and play
To sing future songs
