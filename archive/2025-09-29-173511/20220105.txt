we made it here now
and looking back on our path
grateful for each step

logic and reason
then merged with humility
can complement faith

faith and devotion
stand to help us see farther
than senses allow

Should I then follow
path of stone or path of clay
my steps are the same

move one stone gently
placing it on a small pile
for those who cannot
