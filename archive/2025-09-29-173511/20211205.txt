slowly ticking by
yet with a sickening speed
shifting sands settle

from the midst of joy
comes a tear that remembers
those who are not here

celebrating life
strive to love and to protect
brethren great and small

walking from the pier
the fog swirled around pylons
within the darkness

I did not know it
the time when you said goodbye
but I felt it pass
