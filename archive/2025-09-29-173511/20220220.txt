new borders seeded
planted by fears and worries
that bear twisted fruit

but I can see them
forbears, parents, and children
linking heritage

we cannot make clouds
unless we have rain and chill
beauty from the depths

papers flutter high
on the winds that carry them
further and faster

sit with enlightened
sages, arhats, holy ones
glimpsing inner peace
