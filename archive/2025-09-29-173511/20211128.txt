can we move this now?
the stone created from decades
of actions long done

thus once in motion
the pendulum swings first to
then always returns

celebrate flowers
single snapshots of timelines
from seed to wither

we cannot tell who
started first or finished best
but we see the race

from the lit embers
we can pass on our passions
to others to enjoy
