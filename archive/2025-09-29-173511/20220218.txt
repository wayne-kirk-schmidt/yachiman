coming from us all
are beams and clouds equally
matched in love and gloom

pencils wait, eager
to be grasped and to be used
capturing wonders

reflect on the ink
pooled in the stone yet ready
to travel bravely

simplest of stories
we begin, we live, we love
we endure and go

for remembered loves
our best gift is a blessing
for who they are now
