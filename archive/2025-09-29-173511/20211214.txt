within the rich loam
prospering life will linger
wriggling  to and fro

surely hawks soaring
will spy the dark crests of waves
as they crash on sand

and I want to seek
things unsaid and truths untold
but the time is past

would we know ourselves?
when we move past or behind?
what could we tell us?

struggling to recall
small warm words to salve the wounds
only to lose them all
