should we go on then?
walking in darkness, alone?
reach out for others.

bridges come and go
across lives also chances
always evolving

what have I learned now?
with each day to be stronger
and to lend that strength

simple rice grains sit
in water, waiting their chance
to become a meal

smell savory herbs
that wiggle and sneak flavor
into the best soup
