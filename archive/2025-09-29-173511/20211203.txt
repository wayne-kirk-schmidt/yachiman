resting against dirt
dreaming of happier times
stones wait patiently

matching the passions
as we walk along thin beams
with our reverence

step along water
skipping within high bright arcs
twirling in the sun

voicing simple hymns
reach heaven in harmony
beautifully sung

and the sunset swells
heart with pride and head with joy
waiting for daybreak
