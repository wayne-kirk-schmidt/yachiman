single sentences
flutter in stark white cages
motions of black ink

stand up on the wall
look at the nations below
what is special then?

simple motions start
building up more and stronger
steps in the routine

spend the time today
to love something; care for it
to cherish it well

from soup to the bread
from the meat to the salad
we plan daily meals
