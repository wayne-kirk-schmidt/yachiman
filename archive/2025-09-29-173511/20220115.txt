walk through the forest
cloaked within the grand stillness
yet marvel at life

understand heaven,
being apart, unsullied;
what does it look like?

meeting family
our bond springs up, comforting
reinforcing us

fertile warm mud
chock full of ingredients
possibilities

and now we are nine
we see our youth, past and now
also our future
