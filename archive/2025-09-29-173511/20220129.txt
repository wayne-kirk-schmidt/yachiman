at the beginning
start line chalked on stones holds us
waiting for signals

running on a road
only you and yourself compete
pushing only you

accept the teaching
first rules, then guides, then insight
to build new teaching

the enlightenment
of a monk or president
all stem from stillness

family time spent
sharing a bond between us
sharing strength and love
