slowly the theme builds
taking along playfully
with all of our hearts

with the fifth descend
down a third and transpose then
into vibrant chords

the drums beckon us
with punctuating tempo
to dance with the beat

relish the first meal
fresh spices, and simple tastes
delight in morning

moving to the end
the chords move and sway towards
a gentle finish
