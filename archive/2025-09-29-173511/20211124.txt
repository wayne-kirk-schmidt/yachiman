by little to more
rain gently starts then rages
yet then disappears

present me wisdom
garnered also curated
by experience

where does pure sound start?
from distant sources? ourselves?
both participate

regarding valleys
we see the mountains pathway
also proud return

sermon is spoken
heart listens and mind reflects
the soul understands
