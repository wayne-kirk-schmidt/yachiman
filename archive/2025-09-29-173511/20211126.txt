each bit completed
off a list labeled and done
calms some part of me

do I refer to me
as I? or something else or more?
when I look inside

crumbs small by themselves
put into baskets enough
to feed the masses

walking through the mist
I see the near me and far me
with the bridge bewteen

folding the paper
simple clean precise movements
creating prayers
