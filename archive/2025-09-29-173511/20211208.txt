will gurus then thrive?
of course! their message transcends
and touches people

the beginning strains
reach hearts and gently whisper
of special beauty

kaleidoscopes twirl
dominating our vision
fluid colors dancing

when the arrow bends
from the heavens towards earth
gathering purpose

across pavement stones
running after you or from you?
discovery will wait
