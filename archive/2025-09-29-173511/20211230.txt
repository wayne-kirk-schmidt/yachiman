Ripples propagate
Perfect wee circles dancing
As I throw more stones

Bracing for cold winds
We venture along white roads
Enjoying solstice

The rhythms of life
Breathing pulsing warm motion
Amazing to be

Current of tingles
Coursing shouting lingering
In steamy water

Little and large birds
Chirp and warble screech and cry
Much like us also
