we see what we want
whether be it good or ill
strive then to see good

marathons can push
faster and farther and more
yet compete alone

faded pearls dusty
recalling yesteryear nights
when they flashed and shone

do not let yourself
see outlines or cracks of age
enjoy inner youth

when solving problems
sometimes the best thing to do
is to walk backwards
