small tickle in my nose
tempting rare and wonderful
flowers in springtime

celestial rains
soft blessing and comforting
washing away time

hearts within gardens
blooming, flourishing, thriving
wonderful rich blooms

special branches sway
within the winds in winter
twisting leaves of ice

please look around you
notice with no prejudice
to understand life
