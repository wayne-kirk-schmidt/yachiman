pushing the limits
we can only hope that our goals
will serve us when done

read from all sources
wisdom will come from many
that will build yourself

the beauty of life
expressed in this one gesture
the act of loving

finally we rest
on the river, the stream, the sea
to use as our bed

I will share my life
with world and my family
enjoying the path
