single bells ringing
beautifully announcing
newly coming days

hello my old friend
I have come now to rest here
amid the grey stones

the droplets dry dark
leaving stains of old passion
dying in the night

I walk the hallways
looking for places we sat
speaking about us

the kind glance at dawn
the touch of hands on shoulders
cementing passion
