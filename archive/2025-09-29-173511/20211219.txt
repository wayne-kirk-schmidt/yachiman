happily wander
through the seasons and weekends
as we enjoy time

can it be better?
small cakes and joyful singing
for me, this is best

I will pursue me
finding capability
and celebrate it

how we are older?
wiser and more capable?
experience shows

to rest quietly
then moving purposefully
to love earnestly
