the keeper of me
looks forward also backward
becoming the now

within a quick stroke
the very first brush is placed
completing the word

I shall not go slow
nor am I able to close
my heart or my eyes

precious moments pass
filling our hearts and spirits
with warm sands of time

the tree sprouts upwards
jutting, fighting, spreading wide
life celebration
