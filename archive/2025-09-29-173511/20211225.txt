stepping into snow
crunching so deliciously
within white silence

austere grey tinting
cold morning bespeckled skies
lightening to blue

now I speak with me
instructing and listening
no hesitation

summer's gravid heat
weighing on the brow and soul
yields to gentle rains

shadows sharply dance
in midday sun gently slink
in evening gloom
