walking the pathway
filled with joys and challenges
always rewarding

surprise; the dawning
when we see one plus one yet know
three is the result

how can that be then?
walking on water, curing sick
all begin with seeds

I tell you then write!
Write what is being spoken
and then spread that news

when did it begin?
when he approached a bright bush
to read the letters
