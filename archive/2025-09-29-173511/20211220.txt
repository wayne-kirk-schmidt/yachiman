look at life within time
see life with life side by side
and how it compares

I want to see it
to stare into my own soul
the core within me

try walking on sand
leaving marks of myself there
which will wash away

puppies and kittens
play and grow and learn to be
accomodating

not that we should know
but the best place to start now
is facing forward
