patterns and routines
beautiful collars and ropes
and the most subtle

moving from the note
to the beat from the modal
all within music

please each take your seats
and regard the passion play
and your part in it

something stirred in us
when we heard the news that day
our senses grasping

the best weaponry
are those items that sheath their
capability
