of course! love is there
infusing optimism
swirling with our tea

what will I tell you?
along twenty years? thirty?
you are beloved.

I talk about life
in the language of living
about what you believe

deliver answers
to the orphan the widow
wrap them in caring

when I pause and see
stacks and rows of severe books
splashed with knowledge
