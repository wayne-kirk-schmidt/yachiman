splendidly shining
the skull glitters from the loam
telling great stories

what can the dead teach?
old glories and victories
celebrating life

stark and elegant
the stones sing to us softly
in rare languages

victory tiptoes
inside ourselves and takes root
when we first believe

now that we are five
we nurture secret places
and revel in friends
