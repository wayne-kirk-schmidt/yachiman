from the silent warmth
comfort of evening hearth
we spend together

rounding the corners
we speed and race through aiming
for a fleeting prize

do we surely know?
how the souls of animals
match the souls of man?

not even the mice move
while the lion yawns and stretches
in the hazy heat

Look! there is a boat!
And we wave and jump with hope
mirroring others
