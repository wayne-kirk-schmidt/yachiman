red droplets scatter
from the depths of proffered cups
of the offering

now we will listen
for good or for ill within
the world we live in

present the changes
to the heart and leave them there
watch them grow and bloom

testing the waters
ripples spreading from first steps
calming the ocean

the drum starts slowly
builds, gathering strength and voice
irresistible
