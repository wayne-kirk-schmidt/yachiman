the trilling notes soothe
playing the composition
complicated bliss

pass through the needle
camels follow each other
surprising the monks

push down and pull up
we row through the world we see
navigating streams

the abbess moves sand
into whorls of devotion
remaking them all

the notes slip and slide
all over sheets of music
becoming alive
