special lines of sight
twenty steps or maybe more
between white and black

something so treasured
that defines us at our core
family, faith, friends

we sample the bread
fresh and hot from the oven
in the crisp fall air

descending the stairs
pyramids above below
into art's glory

spend the time at each
eighty eight stations of faith
walking pilgrimage
