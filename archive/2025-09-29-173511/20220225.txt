little glimmers dance
around silver and gold droplets
coming from water

within the dark deeps
swim old large dangerous things
moving within hearts

if I could tell you
what I seen; what I have learned
would that be enough?

standing in heaven
we apprehend salvation
grateful happiness

new things come and yet
old fashions and bigotries
are worn stubbornly
