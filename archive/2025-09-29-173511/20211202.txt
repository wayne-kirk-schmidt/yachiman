working through sorrow
is not hard when you forget
the cause of the ache

it ceases to be
the wound and becomes the scar
building a cover

tissues are ripped
and knit, reripped and reknit
layered endurance

and then finally
when all the pain is complete
the scar will remain

then it has beauty
something very rare and proud
representing ends
