Well then; completed
The final stitch is put in
Completing the mend

If I walk around
What will I see? Fresh new growth?
Or Potemkin walls?

Haunting these hallways
See our twins; doppelg√§ngers
That also walk and breathe

I want for nothing
And yet I desire the world
The contrast startles

Songs sung in rare keys
Match and mix with sweet chorales
Providing a feast
