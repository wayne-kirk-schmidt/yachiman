wishing on future
effort, work, craft, and creation
building from the past

western wall standing
proud, sad, alone, and ancient
attended by song

we shall build towers
to reach heavens and wonders
before scattering

pitch and bitumen
glue reed and rush, wood and frond
home to so many

after the rains recede
and the crows failed to return
the dove is faithful
