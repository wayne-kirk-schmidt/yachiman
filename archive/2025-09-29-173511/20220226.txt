very last measures
matching remaining minutes
what is accomplished?

all along the wall
people watching carefully
for what is to come

make your heart a sun
to blaze brightly, beaconing
for others to see

twilight descending
dusky air gently chilling
as night tiptoes in

on the mountain top
waiting patiently huddled
for the sun's blessing
