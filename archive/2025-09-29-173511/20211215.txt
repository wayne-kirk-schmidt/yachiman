they smile at prayer
feeling something so special
while talking to God

I want to see it
the clear lining on the clouds
bringing us new hope

as rain drops chilled
from grey heavens in wide sheets
shines the sun in all

I embrace my faith
a part of me that yearns for
things outside reason

bright fish move quickly
flitting and darting within
the wide stream bottom
