ending and starting
in seconds something changes
inside not outside

now that we see it
we grasp it and then call it
and we make it ours

the dish is broken
after seeing long service
it is then fitting

but when we slumber
we then visit unknown lands
ready to explore

our best selves can move
work in tandem with worst selves
blending into new
