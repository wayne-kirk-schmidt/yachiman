swept through the river
tears of joy wash out the pain
as water gushes

the smallest dust speck
builds also grows in its strength
the strength of old age

ears curving, bending
to music and to laughter
remember the tears

the horizon sits
in judgement on the present
witness to the past

the simplest colors
first with two, then five, then more
to curious eyes
