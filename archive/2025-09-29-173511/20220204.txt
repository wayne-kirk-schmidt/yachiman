wrinkling creasing smiles
attack and destroy suspicions
all in an instant

fall into flowers
depths of spring into summer
awash in fragrance

illuminate us
with charity and caring
so we reflect love

each new step we take
hearkens back to the old path
and gives us purpose

new chapters written
from the ashes of the old
with pens of white bone
