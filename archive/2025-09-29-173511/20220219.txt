walking through pictures
seeing our younger versions
with a golden glow

the tale of apples
seeded in fertile warm loam
watered and cared for

the ants celebrate
for harvests as they should do
yet scarcely noticed

towers tip swaying
right before the crumbling starts
commented by all

conquering dire beasts
and all feats superhuman
captured in new clay
