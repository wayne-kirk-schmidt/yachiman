secrets to learning
where the simple truth is this
learn to change your heart

pittering downwards
droplets splash and discolor
the evening streets

gazing at Paris
different when young or old
equally lovely

gliding through grey mists
running over tracks and hills
carrying us all

I turn the pages
finding the saying I need
for those special days
