harsh stones softly weep
tears of ages made of rain
erasing the pain

but if I did say
"peace. be well with you also."
would it still suffice?

I speak into masks
and breath around them daily
will it ever stop?

are we in limbo?
chosen for and made by us
when will that end then?

the scripture passage
starts with a small parable
to build up our hearts
