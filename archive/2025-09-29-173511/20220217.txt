I wait on the shore
looking to the horizon
waiting for my love

what can water have
that compels us to return?
a mirror of us

can we speak of it?
the wonder and the grandeur
within human hearts?

wrapping packages
caring and devotional
offered to others

drinking sweet water
breathing clean air in clear skies
simple is soothing
