rushing through pages
we work and live on paper
written each morning

trusting the shallows
where life and beauty lurking
seek to impress us

we will not submit
to shadows and prejudice
but will extend light

once the candle burns
it brightly beckons us on
to watch it dancing

to bury the heart
with distractions does us harm
best it is open
