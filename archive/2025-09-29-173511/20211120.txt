nothing here remains
but wrappers and skeletons
of past deeds and days

we reach out to touch
mirrored faces in the past
and see them touch us

delineating
with flickering lights and sounds
in early morning

I traveled bridges
seeking new inspiration
and building new life

pebbles rattling
against grey stones and brown bricks
as dharma moves on
