making a present
of the lives we live each day
offering that up

feed on the morsels
given with love from others
and in turn, feed them

polish the mirror
set into the sky giving
the moon and the stars

set me down gently
when the day winds down at last
so I can view the world

what is a tunnel?
journey. endpoints. mystery
as we speed along
