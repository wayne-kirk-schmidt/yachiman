dipping our hand in
the cold of the clear water
shocks us with delight

watch a bird flying
right through the open window
pursuing purpose

and I do not know
what to say or to do here
so I stay to learn

as our walls fall down
we wander in the rubble
selecting pieces

thirty years gives pause
three thousand spans memory
what will we have learned?
