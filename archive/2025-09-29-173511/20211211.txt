heated the tongs move
stirring ashes and embers
reawakening

along the grey shore
the birds glide and bank, wheeling
calling so softly

each tree wreathed in snow
remembers new shoots and sprouts
awaiting return

stretch the hand out far
and move it in the summer
youthfully playful

and now we are three
soon then to be thirty-three
watching with wonder
