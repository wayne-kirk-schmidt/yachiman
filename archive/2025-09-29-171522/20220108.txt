all of the time spent
weaves into great tapestries
which comfort our hearts

and if I could reach
far mountains beyond the seas
what would the goal be?

this shows us the world
said the abbot as he stood
on the rock garden

from the beginning
a meal progresses filling
and supporting us

within the small space
seconds can tip the balance
in another's soul
