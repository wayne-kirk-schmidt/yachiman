moving forward on
enjoying the path and steps
singular travel

briefly when we rest
we see ghosts of momentum
coming up to us

gear wheels are turning
accumulating merit
with each rotation

snow or sand they flow
piling, playfully sliding
always in motion

midday a nap came
sneaking gleefully on us
to rest for a bit
