the tide swells and moves
bringing the old days along
replacing with new

I wanted to see
the sun, the moon, and the clouds
reflecting water

changing the mindset
from anger to hope to love
is really small steps

I say take your time
and hurt, grieve, heal, care, and love
these are all needed

shadows in the room
gathered around dying love
comfort the passing
