trusting the spirits
chalking out all the symbols
and chanting each song

then is progress seen?
or as results build and grow
is it rather felt?

something to see now
in the distance, in the dust
something coming soon

finetune your senses
strain to hear the winds whisper
in a gentle moan

retire to the seas
or the lakes between mountains
water flows where it will
