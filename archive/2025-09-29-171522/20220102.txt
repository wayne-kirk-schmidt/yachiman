of course, I hear them
they are going through the world
though others may not

gazing at the stars
and possibly beyond them?
what we see is light

I know the water
is clean and cold also good
washing away sin

simple morning acts
clean the shrine change the water
happily peaceful

watching us evolve
which is an honor for me
as we grow and learn
