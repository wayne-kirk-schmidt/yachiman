pursuing true things
clarifies senses and goals
delivering peace

melodies zigzag
walking through forests of sound
decorating all

shaping not breaking
the watchwords of all parents
watching life flourish

can we see purpose
in the first drops or last waves
illustrating change

always let the stars
shine both on our brow and hearts
gently blessing them
