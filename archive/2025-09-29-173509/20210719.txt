sifting through the past
can inflame or heal your soul
healing is better

no matter where then.
we grow where we are planted
and we strive and thrive

the best work we do
is in the service of love
and the best living

bees easily fly
finding the pollen each day
circulate with peace

when I stomp my foot
I look to scare fierce things off
from our reflections
