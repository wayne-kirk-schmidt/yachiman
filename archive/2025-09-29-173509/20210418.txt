plate, knife, fork, and spoon
keen to celebrate luncheons
dinners, and breakfasts

and the fingers move
across all the scales and chords
mindful of melody

cannot say the name
within the pure land sutra
for what name is there?

brazen and shameless
weakness asks for help and love
to grow into strength

even if holy
no battle provides heaven
only serving pain
