rituals start when
actions are no longer seen
as explainable

something moves in me
ancient also ravenous
seeks forgotten love

mental companions
says the things others do not
simple basic truths

messengers hasten
across bridges down long stairs
bringing morning news

the car is stifling
and the silence deafening
on the dark ride home
