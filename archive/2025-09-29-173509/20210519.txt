Houses special rooms
celebrated by family
Each containing joys

surging! the wave crest
breaks against sharp rocks and sand
and retires again

within the dewdrop
what unseen worlds might there be?
waiting to return

fathom the distance
from deep silence to smiling
measured by hugging

not all angels sing
nor all demons wail and moan
within creation
