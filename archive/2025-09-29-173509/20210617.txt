building the house
takes time, takes love, takes patience
but it is worth it

a man looks keenly
across seas and smiles gently
as the clouds give way

there were three birds then
the hawk, the raven, and the dove
before the peace came

what was the first kiss?
in the mind or in the heart?
or first on the lips?

paper shaped lightning
on pillars of the spirits
giving their blessing
