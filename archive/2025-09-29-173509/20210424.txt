bridging tall mountains
starts with steps on either side
and discarding pride

the Almighty breathes
and the vast seas move and heave
as part of the plan

a single berry
lies on the plate beckoning
ripe, luscious, and red

thread modestly hangs
between tree branches woven
all with cunning care

the millipede walks
a flurry of legs weaving
in the morning mist
