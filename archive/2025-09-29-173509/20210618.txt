exercizing makes
soul and mind expand to fit
the task you will choose

sheep graze on the hill
unaware of the footfalls
of the pack of wolves

pick the right threads
weave them into your heartbeat
to wear as a coat

the end comes to all
and we all seek small reprieves
from our last judgement

life lived in seconds
can be as rich as decades
as we speed along
