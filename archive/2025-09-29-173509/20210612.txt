Nothing is centered
But the step and tread of love
Guided by purpose

When we would look down
At the tombstone and chuckle
They were never there

Alive and dead know
To ask family spirits
To guide and save us

No matter we say
The meal is such a rare treat
No one sees the bones

But to live we eat
To work we will sweat and ache
And these truths keep us
