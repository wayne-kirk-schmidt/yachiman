seconds sliding by
as  the watches monitor
our budget of time

a slice of beauty
wrapped up and presented well
to us at our birth

mentioning the art
we see in the walls and trains
matched by silences

nothing is pure void
yet nothing creates landscapes
when we look at it

I will speak my heart
late at night and to the sea
and listen to waves
