see the current me
gaze at forward and backward
past and future me

new and old beliefs
shaking hands, blending, weaving
composting wisdom

wisteria princess
walking through a spring pathway
balancing petals

wheels are beautiful
motioning and whirring fast
rotary motion

in the deepest sea
within the silent dark cold
life yet sleeps and dreams
