water dries on the floor
as bathwater drains away slow
offering new hope

build bridges not walls
invite neighbors not curse them
we strive to belong

stepping away then
taking the break and breathing
returning just now

the elder monk sighs
looks at the winter garden
seeing the springtime

seeds and roots spread quick
seeking water, search for food
as well as meaning
