looking in journals
written lovingly in ink
telling old stories

enjoy family
savoring the connection
special bonds of love

trolls under bridges
watching, helping, and guiding
unlikely helpers

prize out the caring
from the buildings of our lives
to help build new rooms

from our memory
we build castles we live in
and invite others
