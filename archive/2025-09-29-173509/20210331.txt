mastering time grabs
slippery slithering hours
writhing on a clock

depend on this note
one, true, sure, and proudly sung
heaven's first answer

what if we can fly?
in dreams! bring bodies along
watch our wings unfold

the seal on the jar
silver melted and shaped right
keeping things at bay

we crawl in water
we run to the goal and yet
we yearn still to fly
