single thread dangling
in a portrait of patience
dancing with needles

ghostly fire springs up
from the dark masts and rigging
gifts from Saint Elmo

choosing to enjoy
each rich moment and second
plants peace and insight

simple truths in code
collect, organize, decide
then always evolve

we complete true things
Return on Effort, each Task
ranked by Urgency
