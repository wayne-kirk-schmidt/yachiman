will tasks divided
be better suited or not?
hands and heart must judge

was it the stone steps?
chill with the New York spring air
planting seeds of love?

shrines first were questions
asked quietly then louder
will you show yourself?

first sip of red wine
last sip of bitter coffee
walk along the meal

the eyes droop and close
body slackens peacefully
as sleep cuddles us
