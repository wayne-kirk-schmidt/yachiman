special rules apply
when matters of the heart ask
for our forgiveness

regarding flowers
budding flourishing dying
in a span of days

moving past actions
to see people building new
appreciation

presenting our faith
not in sermons but actions
builds the best bridges

from the mountain top
we leap and soar or plummet
based on confidence
