priests, monks, and prophets
describe our world within hymns
creating new bridges

clear and present need
sets our thinking and pathway
servicing our hopes

walk in dead cities
reading the proclamations
no echos remain

I will teach us now
how to seek and hunt and think
to build our mind strong

when the song is sung
the notes fade into the past
come to memory
