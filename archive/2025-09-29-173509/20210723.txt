what I want to say
and how it can reach your soul
is simple. "love truth"

embrace hope and love
pushing us to be better
it matters and helps

caught in icy lakes
I struggle to reach the shore
within my own dreams

sweat drips and then falls
marking exertion with grace
honoring the work

Stare out at the sea
and feel the vastness rising
till it ends as waves
