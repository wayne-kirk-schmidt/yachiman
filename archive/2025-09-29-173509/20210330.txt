who will be afraid
of the lengthening shadows?
troubled consciences

just before the dawn
in a giant hall watching
movement of others

melismatic sounds
snake up and down harmonies
speaking to heaven

not all threads can bind
to others or to heaven
faith provides and binds

expiration of doubt
maturing into knowledge
with belief's waters
