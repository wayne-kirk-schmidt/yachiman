at the time of storms
rains race through skies and then plunge
into grateful earth

push for loving grace
apply it, seek, it, grant it
to wrap our actions

where do we come from?
from the shores or slopes or clouds?
or yet somewhere else?

as we work the metal
we bring souls forward to life
building our purpose

across the bright shores
crabs march majestically
by generation
