at the time of birth
wide-eyed wonder ; simple joy
writing lists of firsts

tears that stream and clean
old wounds and sluice in healing
bittersweet blessing

if you could talk now?
what would you teach and tell me?
what lessons to give?

rhythmically pulsing
blood stirring as new within
expressing passion

taking careful steps
bridging the now and will be
prophets offer hope
