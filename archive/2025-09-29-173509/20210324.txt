cannons roaring fire
arguing over sovereigns
rights nations weep for

two facing at dawn
lining glinting steel sizing
steps to death and life

with pure land teachings
in the dawning of new truth
false dharma retires

Zomon sensei says
the secrets are in balance
art, faith, and practice

written on our page
life pens lines  in wisdom's path
leading to itself
