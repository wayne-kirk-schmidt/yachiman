simple things support
a small smile and gentle kiss
foundation of love

motorways slide by
rushing through the dying light
anger fueling speed

what could we now do?
move the stone or speak in tongues?
holding mustard seeds

brave pack animals
chilled with early morning light
ring the tired couple

whispering white wings
proclaim the broad majesty
walking the ladder
