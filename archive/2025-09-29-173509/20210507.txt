not from here but there
we draw lines in the wet sand
explaining our hearts

no one emotion
gains our interest like love
building and bonding

eggs lie in the sand
while mama moves to the shore
flippers etching tracks

the beak follows eyes
seeking the meal miles away
from airborne currents

scarabs beetles shine
gilden in sunset on sands
as a warm wind blows
