structuring poems
reaching beyond horizons
gently touching minds

within the circle
radiating from center
rays of hope rush on

measuring minutes
on the horizon of clocks
speeding quickly on

on a white notepad
scrawled in blue pen with glitter
the history of love

brimming full of life
within the park and the pond
stirring in summer
