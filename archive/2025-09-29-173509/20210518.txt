if I grow up now?
where will my young self go then?
to enjoy playtime?

the frosting of snow
tints the eyes and grabs the breath
promising us joy

as the bassline arcs
downwards deep into our ears
mimicking heartbeats

flush with type and ink
the master pulls the press closed
making written word

we ask for heaven
in each step, each word, each thought
to walk beside us
