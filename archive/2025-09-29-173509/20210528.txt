Lamech releases
an arrow that speeds upwards
following purpose

build an ark and live
strong advice for ancient times
good advice for now

within the cocoon
sleeping and waiting for spring
the butterfly waits

never mind the rain
washing away the sins
and brings new chances

sometimes love is seen
from a smile and twinkling eyes
and yellow roses
