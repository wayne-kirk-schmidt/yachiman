I stepped out today
squinting into the sunshine
gazing at shadow

pursue it fiercely
using passion as compass
to steer your efforts

from the twigs and leaves
in high branches and old trees
the smell of summer

I had loved you then
and that care combined with life
faded the bruises

along a pier and shore
staring into dark places
heart slowly healing
