assemble heartbeats
firm them up in solid lines
to view the whole life

but I cannot leave!
says the pale ghost lingering
on the edge of life

read history books
glimpsing it in fits and starts
a quilt of action

hooves ring loud on stones
with familiar clop-clop pace
signals visitors

A letter to God
best written to a penpal
regularly sent
