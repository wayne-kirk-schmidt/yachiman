blue serenity
flowing into the white mist
among rock pillars

not this world but that
not your will but ours guide this
within our dreaming

stepping into light
we see afterimages
of who we once were

fluid memory
dallies at pools and lakes shores
as it recycles

what a gift we have
that we share today and laugh
precious and fleeting
