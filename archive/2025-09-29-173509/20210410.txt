"sweet dreams!" spoken now
as night quietly comes in
swaddling sleepers

what do dreams look like?
filled with nostalgia and grace;
our better selves long gone.

what if you could see
the paths your choices will make?
would that change your ways?

laura the bird singing
sounds like heavens chimes and bells
spreading sweet blessings

bricks in short squat lines
hold honest precious plain lives
celebrating the home
