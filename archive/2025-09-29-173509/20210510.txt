the first chord then next
springs from minor to major
offering up praise

the temple stands firm
separated in three rooms
the path to heaven

softly timid steps
step into the bright presence
to speak for us all

still in that grove stands
a tree that gave shade and helped
the awakening

from the earth we plant
grow, love, water, and nurture
the fruits of the soul
