scalding coffee sipped
in the dim light of morning
before the world wakes

fingers lightly touch
keys like notes wait eagerly
to tell a story

youthful face of hope
foster, feed it delicious
morsels of the truth

sky bleeding dusky
smearing reds and oranges
both at dawn and dusk

lunch boxes are simple
and keep faith with the promise
of delicious breaks
