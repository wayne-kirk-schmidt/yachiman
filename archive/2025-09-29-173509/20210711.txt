nowhere is a place
filled with the grey never times
home to what have beens

enjoy your highs and lows
this amusement park has thrills
that will last for life

package the passion
into a purpose pushing
the best performance

what could be said now
once we see the still body?
we must bid farewell

faith builds in us strength
not in what is seen; instead
in what is unseen
