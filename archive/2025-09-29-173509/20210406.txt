I work through studies
muscles and sinews made strong
repeating lessons

but gift the small child
with three blessings for future
love. hope. charity.

pain creeps by edges
teasing me with the small aches
fresh accomplishments

marathons show you
who you are; how you will be
and what will drive you

chill winds throughout March
small gusts playfully tease out
lasts gasps of winter
