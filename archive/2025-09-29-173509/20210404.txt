rain spatters on us
blessings washing away tears
leaving us hopeful

chasing a swift sun
circling and hurtling
moons and planets dance

can these bones yet live?
asked prophets looking skyward
amazed by reply

bridges to somewhere
crossing all nowhere with ease
ushering us on

mountains stand upright
evolving as we all do
see old and new growth
