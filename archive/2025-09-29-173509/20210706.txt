wading into surf
cold stinging salt sea splashing
pursuing the dawn

moving eyes upwards
around and then finally
staring at the ground

quickly! the brush flies
moving rivers of dark ink
on waiting paper

Metal and alloy
by oneself or with others
how you forge yourself

the meal is eaten
silently, reverently
after thanks are said
