the dream ends in sweat
and fears of falling asleep
just like that it fades

never could somewhere
living in everywhere
be content with there

the spaces and dots
yield special truths for seekers
in gematria

walking within fog
we see shadows profoundly
but what can they do?

simple and filling
soup made of roots and tubers
bubbles happily
