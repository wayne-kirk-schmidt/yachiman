you forge the result
each day each step each motion
with hope for a goal

please make no mistake
the face we wear outside us
is a reflection

snow falling outside
silently roars in mountains
echoing mutely

regarding footsteps
millions of years old and yet
you can see purpose

a cup with crayons
and glue hair with button eyes
a child's special gift
