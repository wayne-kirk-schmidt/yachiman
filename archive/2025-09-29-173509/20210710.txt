salt, and bitter herbs
hold their place at the table
at the extra seat

faster than the wind
speeding into the heavens
to speak with angels

the recitation
started by one in a cave
commanded to write

seven times around
circling, part of a whole
faithful are walking

right at the crossroads
midnight with rum and cigars
to speak with Baron
