good people striving
draw the map of piety
travel roads of peace

we cannot sing songs
unless our hearts have the notes
then such music rings

flexing wings in flight
coming down from mountain thrones
riding clouds as waves

the mirror shows depths
of souls, oaths, and silences
helping seekers see

inventions bless us
giving us simple magic
something done anew
