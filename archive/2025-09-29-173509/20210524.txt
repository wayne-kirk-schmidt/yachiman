Broken pottery
strewn along the path of tears
cannot catch sorrow

I want to present
my true self to the whole world
reflecting my soul

we sift through the dirt
finding the seams and deep veins
the start of ourselves

what cannot be touched
lies in our reach tempting us
to make the attempt

a fragile wing beats
beautiful feathers flutter
in the morning sunlight
