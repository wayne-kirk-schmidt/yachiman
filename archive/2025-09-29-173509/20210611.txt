screaming from fatigue
righteous acts wash in the sea
rest and start again

here I place my dreams
within the field where they grow
building a garden

but can we consent
to weed and prune those ideas
different from us?

I am comforted
family life blooms and grows
yielding the best fruits

when the door is locked
and all the lights gently dimmed
peace roams grey shadows
