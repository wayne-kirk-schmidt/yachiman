when summer chills come
crisp air teasing around us
bringing memories

words spoken, rushing
harsh from the tongue said in haste
smashes into love

the rock is pushed up
rolling and sliding downward
for eternity

just as planets rush
people glide along paths unseen
walking together

labels created
affixed outward and beckon
us to look further
