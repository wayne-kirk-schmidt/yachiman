could can we run then?
Into dark, along the shore
stretching forever

angels lean on clouds
and regard the world below
tower rising fast

special flames burning
removing the past right now
leaving the future

grasping the bottle
ceremonial motion
smashing in red clouds

I find prayer helps
to find God to find myself
in peaceful silence
