parent to children
learn and teach at the same time
children to parent

what have we learned then?
there is more than addition.
enriching others

look beyond the sea
when it speaks to you softly
of unseen treasures

walking the island
start at the harbor early
finish at the park

cycling in cities
provides backdrops of motion
balancing your thoughts
