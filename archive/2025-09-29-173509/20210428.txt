strings are small and light
joining, bonding, become more
to secure the heart

I cannot speak it
but I feel the connection
that sits inbetween

what could be the cause?
of a bird to glide or fall?
the touch of heaven

spend the youth wisely
look for value and treasure
the time with others

finally, I came
to a fork in the dark road
what path did I take?
