the cymbal rings once
pure note ascending on high
amidst the incense

central books of thought
capture only what we were
and not who we are

walking the circle
smaller slices move closer
towards the center

adjust our own gaze
to see the changes in life
on this quaint small home

moths and butterflies
both dance and flex their thin wings
describing beauty
