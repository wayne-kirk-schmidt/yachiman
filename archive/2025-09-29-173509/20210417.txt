flashes and roaring
with leonid savagery
strange how they do bloom

I sit next to ghosts
and while we talk they and I
we see futures pass

droplets spatter down
smashing also caressing
while the storm strides on

into their eyes we look
and see hope and love and joy
strong family bonds

when the small fist clasps
around fingers something sparks
igniting you love
