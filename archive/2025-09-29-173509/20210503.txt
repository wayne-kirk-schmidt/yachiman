first and last notes slip
around and wander then land
from ears to the heart

well starts to fill up
as I sit in the center
speaking in darkness

right at the cliff edge
looking at temptation
at the last day's end

we write codices
fill with secrets and puzzles
chasing mysteries

we cannot mark days
with black or purple or blue
but measure edges
