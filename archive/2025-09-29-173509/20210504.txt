we care to measure
time within moments blurring
as clocks are spinning

actions always weighed
what is right and what is now
always balancing

he lays his head down
and the eyes close peacefully
tranquility reigns

purse the lips whistle
shrill at first then warm and deep
to alert and call

all things eat to live
yet do we consider where
the meals started from?
