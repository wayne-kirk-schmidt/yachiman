This is enough now
moving him into the sun
so grandpa can see

twin globes regarding
each other across dark space
regally dancing

crabs are scuttling
enjoying the surf and sand
of their own wet world

feathers grow and spread
across wings made for soaring
within the white clouds

secrets attach to hearts
and yearning to be spoken
whisper of freedom
