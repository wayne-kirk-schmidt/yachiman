The purest sound lies
in the ears of the newborn
relishing the notes

I see toes and thumbs
and feel ribs and hips and chest
circumscribe my life

push the message up
to heaven and back ringing
with the sounds of grace

space the heart with joy
inscribe the mind with gladness
mandala of love

I shall not hate you
I will watch, learn, and defend
I will study peace
