the key is balance
live your life or carve buddha
seek the middle path

I choose now to sleep
and move from day to dreaming
to see who visits

small deer nod their heads
and push and shove for crackers
messengers of gods

within moving mists
the shadows run and scamper
to visit the town

water laps the boat
as we knife through our home port
when the day will end
