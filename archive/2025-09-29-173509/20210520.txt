seeds of our efforts
planted, well-watered. blooming
will nourish us well

what is in the mud?
future life? ancient habits?
dreams of brave new worlds?

look well into both eyes
search for lives before our lives
planning our journeys

distances of words
closing gaps, making breaches
fashioned from our speech

what the master sleeps
as holiness rolls off like fog
spreading to the world
