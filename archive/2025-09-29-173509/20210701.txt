seconds compressing
into mountains we enjoy
of our memories

first there then now gone
enlightenment and knowledge
changing within us

boundaries can melt
evaporate into mist
but we need to choose

our central digits
within the hand, heart, and foot
reflect and define

the prior add up
to the present sums we see
that create new patterns
