dipping slightly now
the long ship's prow slices through
water at first dawn

mountains with blue mist
balancing and completing
fields with red sunset

cannot! should not! no!
positive, not negative
can do. should do. yes.

small spans of our time
outlined in seventeen steps
are the most precious

heart colored in love
has eyes happily festooned
hands draped in kind grace
