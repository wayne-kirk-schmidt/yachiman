paper moves and dances
around a flame, twirling high
disappears in sparks

fish fins twitching slow
in the depths as waters flow
in sea waves which grow

regarding my hands
flexing the fingers slowly
I see history

water sloshes out
and spilling into the earth
as both food and fuel

shadows are imprints
photographs made out of dark
after images
