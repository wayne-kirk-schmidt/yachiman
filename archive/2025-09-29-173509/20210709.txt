not without some pain
but with the best intentions
striving and living

in the world of peace
unity over chaos
from the world of war

I measure my lifetime
in moments well spent in bright
where all was then well

tread across the shore
moving then over water
towards the shadows

Prioress Alma
lights both candles and incense
with Brother Martin
