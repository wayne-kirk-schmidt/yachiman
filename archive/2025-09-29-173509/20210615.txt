the color of moons
and clouds and crests at high tide
pale and austere

leeched of color
spindles of bone are clasped tight
around rosaries

sweet and sugary
frosting arcs around brownies
crowning the desserts

mind jot and tittle
the monk seeks to preserve words
spoken long ago

pressing, printing screeds
starkly outlined with the truth
thus revolts begin
