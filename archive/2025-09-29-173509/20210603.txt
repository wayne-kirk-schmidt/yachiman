filling out our hearts
with hopes and dreams burning bright
attracting new friends

we do not think this
we do not see or feel that
but we are here now

sheeps head-nodding says
wait for the beasts in the field
to sleep and to dream

built out of paper
a lantern with flame within
walks up to heaven

not that the ends stop
nor would the middle begin
but stay where they are
