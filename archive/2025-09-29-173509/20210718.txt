what can I be now?
father, husband, and a son.
all of this and more

in the moon center,
it is dark, lonely, and cold
outside shining bright

deer gently bowing
in the middle of the grass
divine messages

staring at the beams
moved into place long ago
pleasant musty smells

I read an old book
and hearing the ancient words
my mind rejoices
