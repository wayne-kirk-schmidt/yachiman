when the journey ends
burdens are laid by their side
then we join our friends

the keen eyes spot it
a speck in ocean, in sky
moving closer now

brass clasps shelter
volumes of ancient wisdom
within tan leather

stepping in water
reflections in the ripples
of my younger face

how do they judge us?
By wealth? By Health? By Wisdom?
Yardsticks give witness
