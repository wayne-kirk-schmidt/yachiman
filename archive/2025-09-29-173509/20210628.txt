come tell me the tale
of how we flew on cloud wings
when daybreak was new

see in the soup broth
clouds of salt and savoury?
swirling with flavor

nothing moves us more
than us recognizing love
allowing it's rule

minimal dust specks
rolling along the floorboards
origin unknown

unwritten journals
hold perspectives of our birth
before we were us
