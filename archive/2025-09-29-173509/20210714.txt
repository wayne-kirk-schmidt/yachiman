Endymion looks
far away across water
seeing growing specks

within the second
exists worlds and loves and lives
if we know to look

fish out from the sea
the heart of my ancestors
wearing it proudly

strategy is set
and the pieces put in place
waiting to begin

cool soothing dark earth
swallows the day , consumes cares
offers peaceful rest
