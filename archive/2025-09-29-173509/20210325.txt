simple cherished meals
vegetables rice and soup
shows a healthy path

be quiet! be unseen!
complying abrades the soul
and dulls the spirit

threading that needle
say prayers only for blessings
stops camels and us

what is experience?
is it layered on my hands?
or within my soul?

quiet night whispers
between partners exchanging hope
celebrating love
