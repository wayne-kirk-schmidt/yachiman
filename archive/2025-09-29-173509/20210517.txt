pressing our faint hearts
more than it has gone before
love strengthens us all

lingering questions
that do not need to be asked
part of history

our soul therapy
is to step with honesty
from past to future

do we each cherish
self-created by mirrors?
best to clearly see

I have done good things
I have failed to do good things
I have been human
