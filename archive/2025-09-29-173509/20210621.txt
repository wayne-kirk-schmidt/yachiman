passing here we see
stones proclaiming deeds long done
as sand shifts and stirs

afternoons can afford
the teaching that memories
can provide for us

spring into the sea!
dive deep into briny murk
to see prior ages

round tables are meant
for discussion and sharing
as teams will begin

delicate flavors
made of vinegars and salt
to round out the meal
