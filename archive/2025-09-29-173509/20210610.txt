weaving in the words
with the meaning and loving
poets build beauty

shrike descends keening
for the life he will soon take
necessarily

my face shows a tear
only shed after talking
and she walks away

sorrow also joys
framing our days seasoning
our taste of this life

can you blame them now?
never; they tried just as you
their walk is their own
