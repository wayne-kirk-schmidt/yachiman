something I try now
builds my resolve for action
sets me on the path

simple flowers bloom
briefly shine, dazzling then
simple flowers wilt

reading nourishes
to learn and explore new worlds
with your mind as guide

exploring new things
tang of fear; ache of effort
encouraging us

writing the poems
completing the holy texts
with fleeting wisdom
