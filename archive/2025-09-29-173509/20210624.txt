can you step lightly
through the memories and dust
that are my great loves

confessing the truth
occasionally painful
always the best choice

summertime breezes
sail in and whisper coyly
of beaches and sand

stark outlines remain
of the once massive bonfires
smoking memories

gaze at chrysalis
the home for young life within
and yet a prison
