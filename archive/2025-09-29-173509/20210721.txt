spend the time singing
future songs from long ago
what music it is!

regulate my breath
with each, I learn how to see
the steam of our souls

we build new castles
out of ice, of sand, of brick
fleetingly serene

mother duck and child
walk through the street happily
commanding others

the last step is giant
leaping into new valleys
on our next journey
