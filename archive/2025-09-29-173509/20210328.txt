start small. build from that.
enjoy the small steps in sand
learning how to run

challenging heaven
grasping at angelic robes
moving on ladders

seals remain in place
keeping the secrets within
that may not be shown

shuffling his feet
along the beach the seeker
dances in water

within deepest depths
fires burn flaming hot within
under burnished brass
