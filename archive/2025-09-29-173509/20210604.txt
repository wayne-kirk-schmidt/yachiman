What if we could scale
Walls of wonder and wishes
what would we find there?

Old body and new
coats that we wear as we change
each fits and gives warmth

fishes in oceans
wonder at skies seen dimly
and what they contain

appetites control
the best and the worst of us
creatures of hungers

I want our new love
to be better than the past
as well as lasting
