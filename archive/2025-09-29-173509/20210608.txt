move along the line
from Abraham and Noah
into the future

movements with chords
framing joy and then sorrow
as music guides us

each face then looks out
north south east and then westward
as guardians stand

thus from his promise
devotion again repaid
fathering nations

take the robe and go
be in the world and also
walk the path of faith
