washing the fingers
watching the water trickle
along veins and flesh

memories can cleanse
from sin from stain from hardship
if we allow it

i looked through a book
of names, numbers, and places
looking for the past

what makes us ourselves?
our beliefs or our actions?
or how we can learn?

each church I visit
helps me to define myself
how I seek heaven
