I can feel raindrops
strike the floorboards of my soul
each leaves a pattern

supernaturally
we list our last and first sights
visual traces

drift through the summer
savor the warmth of the day
within the moment

we regard the truth
within actions day to day
showing our practice

bodies bravely keep
our true selves sleeved and waiting
for next steps beyond
