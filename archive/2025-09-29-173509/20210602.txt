specialized footsteps
balancing on threads of hope
come from our joined hearts

at night apartments
looking out on city streets
while perched up on high

water circling
around an island at tide
while the city sleeps

with each step taken
closer to the goal yet far
from the place we start

when done before next
for the briefest of seconds
we know a stillness
