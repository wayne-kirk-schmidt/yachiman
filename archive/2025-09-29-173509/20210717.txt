chase after papers
corral them and order them
again and again

sweep clean of your mind
and in the debris that floats
away peace returns

prayer provides help
for others and for ourselves
a daily compass

relish the aches and pains
effort brings a sense of pride
flavoring the day

what I did not know
I learned today, yet new things
await tomorrow
