moths dancing in dusk
circling bright flickering
candles beckoning

when we can do this
reverse the flow cancel tides
we have learned balance

stately branches arc
over trunks that serenely
watch over the forests

what must he have felt?
at last see the promised land
yet cannot enter?

the bells of Saint Mark
join voice with other churches
marking passing hours
