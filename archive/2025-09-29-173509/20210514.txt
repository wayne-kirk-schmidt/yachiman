discs scythe through the air
bleed light with every stroke
Gilden predators

bass scuttles around
building up to the bass kick
who fears one three eight?

hymns and evensong
touch the same points in music
the need to connect

dawn moving forward
dismantling dusky haze
pouring through the fog

above the earth and stars
watchers gazing on earthly lives
consider action
