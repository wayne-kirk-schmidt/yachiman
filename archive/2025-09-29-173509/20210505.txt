what was it about?
the half-remembered spark flaring
into dull anger

master said to see
gaze at nothing and something
the lines of the soul

a simple carrot
in the soil orange and green
proud of its purpose

delicate white hands
pose with the finest silk gown
the doll does not move

I cannot persuade
the heart from a course of love
that path must be walked
