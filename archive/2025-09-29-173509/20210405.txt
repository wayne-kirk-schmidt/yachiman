striding through the sky
first, fog. then clouds, and then mist
water seeks the way

to and fro swinging
the ball, our eyes, up and down
rest into motion

Gautama laughing
the world wonders at the joke
yet he sits and smiles

ant walls and bridges
building up and tearing down
colony bustles

inscribe all the names
and what would your list be now?
and what will it be?
