klaxons are silent
in the seconds just before
explosion is felt

feet walking on sand
fingers grasping sandcastles
slipping through water

each station a shrine
circling the world invites
the faithful to pray

frogs calmly sitting
waiting for their future lives
entombed within rock

small sizes contain
large ideas and lofty schemes
cloaked in humility
