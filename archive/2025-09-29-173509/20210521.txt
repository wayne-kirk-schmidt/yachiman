fight against the world
that says "no" also "never"
that struggle is good

how do we value
a soul, life, or legacy?
carefully with love

mixing into soup
savory, salty, and sweet
expanding flavours

the chair is empty
and has been for decades now
what would you tell it?

when things end they feed
the living and surviving
to build better worlds

the dog barks in fear
and though I respond with cheer
sadness walks there too
