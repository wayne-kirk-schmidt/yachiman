mercer the spider
walks along a simple path
glistening silken strand

high pitched warbling
slow then fast, soft then louder
greeting the new dawn

moving through the fog
past years lost days forgotten
Till I see them new

supporting vision
dark and light behind each door
heavenly signposts

does a burden cease?
will it turn into white clouds?
when the debt is paid?
