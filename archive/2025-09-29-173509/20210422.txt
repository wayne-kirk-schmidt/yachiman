I wish I could see
the light that streams from your soul
as you sleep and dream

the can is rusted
brown and brittle yet hints at
a gleaming bright past

butterflies floating
on spring air and summer breeze
flickering beauty

Do not hate or rage
instead seek understanding
healed by perspective

speeding to the end
finest notes dance the movement
sublime sounds streaming
