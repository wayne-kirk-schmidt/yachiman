dust showers slightly
sifting over possessions
blessing from ages

tributaries flow
accumulate inertia
provide lineage

the whisper of dawn
shrouding the shout of daylight
with night promises

bleached white and austere
echoing the legacy
of a life well lived

asking about then
just like rubbing the old scars
celebrates those wounds
