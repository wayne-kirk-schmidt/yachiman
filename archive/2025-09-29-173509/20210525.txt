gently wrapped in clouds
shining gently on sleepers
welcome monthly guide

I could not speak now
but I can sing special songs
composed in silence

resting on my arm
my grandchild I know and love
breathing quite gently

never quit in seeking
a passion that you enjoy
which will clothe your soul

I could see it then
breakdown; passion withering
at the train station
