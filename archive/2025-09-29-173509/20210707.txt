a page then more comes
diligently, carefully
as the story is born

circling around,
life wraps death, which then wraps life
defining our lives

the great waves crash down
flooding senses, moving limbs
bringing us to life

sparrows stop and chirp
tilting their heads so coyly
in the grey morning

please ask the mountain
how it could hide then appear
over and again
