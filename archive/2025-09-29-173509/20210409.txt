spinning towards light
always seeking like for like
continually

blue sparks leap and dance
building courage to break free
speeding towards ground

calibrating love
is done daily and hourly
and builds for lifetimes

first shake a current
fields appear dancing and then
the current returns

exchange our first words
with ones over sixty years
what will be the same?
