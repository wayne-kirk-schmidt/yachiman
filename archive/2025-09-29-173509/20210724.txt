fish spines gleaming white
within the boiling liquid
the soup is ready

do not look away
this is the place for your eyes
the home for your heart

Since I moved so much
I will travel even more
And the road goes on

We place the book down
And gently turn off the light
just as sleep returns

What I hope for now
Is to say to everyone
I am so grateful
