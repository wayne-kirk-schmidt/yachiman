building up patience
with you, heavens, and myself
exercise the soul

how do I know me?
what makes myself my own self?
precious and secret

water flowing down
drenching flowers, slaking thirst
always returning

change always happens
charges or sneaks depending
our desire to meet

science and logic
tools that balance and mirror
our faith and instincts
