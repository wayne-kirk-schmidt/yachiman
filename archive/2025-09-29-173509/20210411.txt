what are the shapes then?
what I wanted and needed?
circles squares and more

wolves run in large packs
one of so many members
loyalty runs deep

what can we do then?
cry and laugh and cheer and move
forward and onward

planning the world
and summarizing our reach
circumscribing us

a meal of our heart
delicious yet bitter
eaten for the time
