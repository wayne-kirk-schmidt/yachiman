branches are choices
simple at first then sprouting
newer decisions

blood drips from fingers
that removed flesh from the bone
preparing the meat

I cannot think now
but I float in memory
until I reach me

sturdy and assured
resolute over sand dunes
we march to the sea

are ghosts evil? no.
they are memories looking
reflecting ourselves
