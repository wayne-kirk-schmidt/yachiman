fluttering downward
strobe quietly white and blue
alive and fragile

demagogues smiling
stirring up false loyalty
whisper noble lies

start with the heartbeat
sure, steady, constant drumming
calming our own soul

examine our hands
looking at lines and at cuts
history of flesh

remembrance; leads us
into forests and mountains
finally the sea
