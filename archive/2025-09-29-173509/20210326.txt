try! and within that
comes seeds of constant progress
building yielding fruit

you cannot speak them
but see the words on your tongue
can this be called truth?

flame gutters in blue
gasping for breath seeking food
and a way to speak

all along the peak
single lights bob and jiggle
at the door to gods

red architecture
splits the mundane from holy
where the spirits rest
