Hopping and springing
blend with grass colored waters
frogs alive smiling

achieving the summit!
giving you the smallest rest
to glimpse the next peak

between troughs and crests
seas so dark it seems like night
endlessly moving

A one-armed man speaks
wistfully answering you
giving simple truths

"That cannot be drawn!"
artists gesture and exclaim
a face of true void
