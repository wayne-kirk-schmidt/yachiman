hands flexing slowly
in the cold, in the morning
before the day's work starts

tiny droplets sing
and splash onto windowpanes
the aria of spring

plunge your toes in mud
feel the breathing warmth on skin
as earth speak to flesh

we can reconcile
step forward then greet the past
before walking on

be strong and caring
see others with open eyes
service within love
