house gently comforts
the family as they thrive
exploring new life

flying through heaven
what will we see? long past loves?
and other dear sights?

presenting myself
delivering the utmost
lovingly sharing

extinguished sun's dust
spreading this across the stars
greetings from the dead

even a blood-red moon
hints promises of the sun
moving in the sky
