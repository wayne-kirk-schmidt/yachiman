onto victory
people shout and run headlong
into the unknown

I wish we had time
to review and discuss now
yet we have the past

no teardrop falls now
they have dried on the pale cheeks
after words have been said

stand in the middle
of grain, of land, and of life
and count the harvest

if we knew hardship,
when we started our journey,
what would that change now?
