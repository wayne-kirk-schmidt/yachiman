work through the longing
seek white wings moving upwards
measuring motion

turning all pages
show the progression in plot
from old to the new

"now hand me the reigns"
as the chariot speeds on
blue hands give guidance

Believe in the hope
and understand messages
are simply waysigns

I dream I run fast
along ridges of mountains
enjoying the height
