something small and bright
glitters and glistens all night
our heart sets it right

I cannot fathom
spiritual worlds in worlds
faith should be simple

master oda waits
steps onto the stage and says
truths simple and new

what can be done now?
with the love that has fallen
away from our sight?

stepping from our hearts
from blackness of past pain
towards the new light
