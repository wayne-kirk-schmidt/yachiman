hands touching the wall
ancient and worn, washed with tears
as prayers are said

sitting in a grove
the world melts and falls away
buddha is smiling

belief is special
fickle and fleeting yet brave
building strength and sight

leaving from Heaven
glide to earth, land in Eden
providing wisdom

beauty in decay
rusted spires, dusty splinters
showing inner form
