suddenly nourished
by simple bread with fish given
to amazed thousands

eyes light up in joy
as the spine and head align
enlightenment comes

on heavenly bridges
he and she circle pillars
first couple dances

the thunderbird shrieks
in the coming storm eyes blazing
with lightning feathers

two riders approach
while the wind moans and rain weeps
between minarets
