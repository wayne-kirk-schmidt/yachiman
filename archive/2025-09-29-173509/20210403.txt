spend it wisely now
yourself, your faith, your effort
help you and others

what can be undone?
nothing concrete not the past
but new days bring hope

reflect in mirrors
splashing across misty lakes
light scatters gently

face each day pupil
with the joy to see new things
and wisdom to act

when the book closes
the final sentence echoes
we long for the next
