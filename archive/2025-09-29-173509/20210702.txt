the wine has gone cold
and the plate has crumbs and scraps
gloriously ate

specialized rivers
waters crying and flowing
within our own hearts

uttered lyrics slide
on notes and bars teaching us
the beauty of song

sunken, forgotten
the wreck shows its bones to us
as if to say "come"

walking to her school
stating hope in fearful times
masked as is her friends
