working with numbers
changes are so beautiful
showing new patterns

how to deal with pain?
cry and moan, laugh also pray
yet sleep works the best

when the world has gone
and we remain in this grove
we rebuild with love

nothing on earth lasts
within that is the beauty
cherish each moment

from the bed now wake!
rise and face the day anew!
spread love to us all
