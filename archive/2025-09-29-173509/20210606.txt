mother and child move
across the home and the world
the bond giving hope

package up our hope
into determination
we will push for change

cannot show my hands
but I can show my imprints
fresh within the snow

special movements seek
havens for our hope and faith
building strong arches

the final breath warms
the air and spreads the blessing
as we then move on
