regarding glasses,
if half-full or half-empty?
changes as we do

could you speak up now
say what you said for decades
would that still be heard

moving more than Mach
small objects with purposes
within the night sky

drums contain first skins
bones and spines and memories
of music before

tired although happy
the mother and father gaze
on the newest child
