within the bubbles
are worlds within worlds
lasting for seconds

the wolf in us all
sees things simply and plainly
fight or feed or flee

we keen for small things
and wish for the past sometimes
tears shed for changes

the tuxedo fits!
shielding us in fancy dress
newly meet others

four or six voices
plainsong showing our deep passions
within counterpoint
