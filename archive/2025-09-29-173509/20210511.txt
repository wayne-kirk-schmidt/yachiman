broken and rebuilt
showing the deep scar tissue
caring will endure

never give up now
strengthening and covering
the past and future

shouting in silence
wall of grey and land of fog
the echoes are stilled

Missing the heartbeat
so close and yet far away
as goodbye is said

silver arcs through dusk
a ring sees the bay at last
before plunging in
