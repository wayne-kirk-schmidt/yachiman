itinerant thoughts
moves between minds planting seeds
until they take root

eating offerings
humble gifts from the faithful
the priest blesses us

rainbow appearing
over blue tranquil waters
solemn promises

children play in sand
white wet castles built and smashed
in seconds rebuilt

the ancient trees sway
with knowledge of the wood green
wild and powerful
