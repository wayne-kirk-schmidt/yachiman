quick cursive skating
cross silent barren landscapes
and bring to life worlds

never could we measure
limits of spirit and hearts
the fathomless wells

all things with purpose
striving towards improvement
watching where they were

sense subtle changes
slightly stronger and faster
and seeing clearer

the last rose to bloom
enjoys sunlight to the full
in petal gravey
