view the face and see
parents and more within there
lineage of love

pulsing steadily
bass notes and an underbeat
exploring new worlds

expositions show
our need for the storyline
and set up the stage

analysis strives
teasing apart the results
makes hypotheses

can we express it?
a function of belonging?
in family, yes.
