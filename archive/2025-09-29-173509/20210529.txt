footsteps on the stage
starting, trying, exploring
a dance of our life

I do not see it
the new soul within the soul
but I see the glow

castles made of sand
kingdoms within coming tides
rising and falling

I will push the stone
and see that it moves and rolls
each day after day

eyes that look at age
see the steps, paths, and choices
listening to tales
