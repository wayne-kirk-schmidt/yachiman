feasting on sunlit
meals to last and dazzle us
moon shining brightly

within the valley
bleached bones silently waiting
will they ever move?

what should I be then?
The best son? Father? Grandchild?
first, just the best me.

ask everything
all questions of love and life
and drink in answers

can you love others?
who are very different?
of course. with great ease.
