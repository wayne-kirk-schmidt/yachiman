my heart's beating drum
silent and yet powerful
brings you close to me

single mournful cry
moves quickly through the morning
becoming joyful

just before midnight
watching the lights and motion
basic night patterns

three notes of heaven
major diminished and third
herald arrival

bright wings of heaven
great accomplishments capped with
commemoration
