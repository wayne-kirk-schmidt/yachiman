When I fall on mountains
first I walk then run then flow
and rejoin family

nothing is certain
but the taste of first and last
makes the meal complete

can we accept love?
are we capable of trust?
I say always "yes"

hauntingly, flutes speak
telling of joys and sorrows
breathy confessions

I see the road now
crooked, dusty, full of grime
but my path I love
