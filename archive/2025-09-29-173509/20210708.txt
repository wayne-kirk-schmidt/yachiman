walk with the sand dunes
shifting, sliding as they do
moving in deserts

apples and peaches
glistening ripe on branches
fruit of care and time

within frozen lakes
lie the souls of all that lived
drawn to the dark peace

but we need to rest
reflecting on the sunset
before we can wake

my memory laughs
at things I feel are my past
that never occurred
