turning left and right
cutting through white fog and mist
driving through the night

when the apple decides
it saw the whole of the world
it falls towards it

each pole at each end
guides the fields and the currents
ferrying charges

first, there are mountains,
encasing books of ages
each page writ in bone

it barely slows
but tilt then wobble then lurch
the top rests again
