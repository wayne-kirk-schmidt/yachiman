cicadas calling
the heat trembles in the air
time stands in their song

waves collapse in foam
children chase them, laughing loud
sunlight on their skin

bamboo leaves whisper
in a restless summer breeze
shadows dance on walls

sandals on hot stones
steps quicken across the bridge
river cools the feet

a red paper fan
folds the heat into silence
soft wind on the cheek

late fireworks bloom
petals of fire in the sky
echoes drift to earth

mountain paths alive
with the sound of trickling streams
water’s quiet hymn

a dragonfly rests
on the rim of a clay pot
wings made out of glass

festival lanterns
paint the alleys with their glow
summer night unrolls

the hammock sways slow
between two forgiving trees
a nap becomes dream

long grass bends gently
beneath the weight of the sun
field sighs into dusk

koi rise to the edge
rippling circles widen out
bread crumbles like snow

farmer’s hat pulled low
against the stubborn brightness
sweat salts the furrows

children on the pier
dropping lines into the waves
hope in every cast

sunset lingers red
the horizon hesitates
before letting go

fireflies wander
through the darkened forest edge
tiny constellations

the tea is bitter
yet cooled with fresh river stones
shared beneath the pines

a kite still flying
long after the children slept
wind plays on its own

shoreline stretching wide
seashells gather every tide
secrets of the deep

the field of lilies
burns white under summer stars
fragrance fills the path

storm breaks in the night
rain slams hard on wooden eaves
heat sighs, disappears
