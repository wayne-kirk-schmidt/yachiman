sun climbs through the mist
golden hands stretch over hills
warming every stone

fields drink the sunlight
grain sways in a golden tide
harvest on the rise

through the temple gate
sunlight falls across the floor
patterned with old prayers

sun ignites the sea
waves catch fire at the horizon
burning into dusk

shadows lean away
obedient to the flame
drawn by its command

the sunflower turns
faithful to the daily path
face against the light

children on the shore
paint their laughter in the sun
sand becomes a stage

the desert shimmers
air bends beneath the fierce heat
mirage drifts like smoke

warmth on tired hands
farmer rests against the field
smiling into sky

morning light filters
through the canopy of leaves
diamonds on the ground

sun splits the dark clouds
like a blade of molten steel
victory of day

city streets ablaze
glass towers reflect the fire
echoes of the sun

noon burns without pause
cicadas cry even louder
time halts in the glare

sunset paints the walls
crimson strokes across the clay
day yields to the night

shadows shrink to none
at the height of summer’s reign
world bows to the sun

sun warms the mountain
snow retreats in tiny streams
stone breathes once again

a sparrow takes flight
through a curtain of sunlight
wings made of fire

twilight’s dying glow
lingers on the quiet lake
one last golden kiss

clouds part reluctantly
yet the sun insists its way
patience shining through

ancient sundial
marks another fleeting day
stone remembers all

rays pierce the forest
lighting paths the eye can’t see
guides for those who seek
