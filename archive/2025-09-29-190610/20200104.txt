bare branches reaching
against a pale brittle sky
all colors have fled

rain upon stone steps
slick with the weight of the year
footsteps echo cold

pumpkins at the gate
hollow smiles lit from within
flicker in the dusk

old scarecrow tilts down
his straw hat frayed by the wind
guarding emptiness

the last cricket sings
alone in the frozen grass
its voice almost gone

ravens on the roof
discuss the thinning harvest
shadows gather close

a pond half-frozen
holds the memory of reeds
cracking in the wind

lantern light quivers
across the abandoned square
night accepts the town

apples left to rot
sweetness turns into decay
earth reclaims the gift

thin frost on the rail
hands withdraw too quickly now
wood resists the touch

the field forgotten
furrows drowned in mist and rain
dreams of spring lie still

children kick the leaves
their laughter wakes the silence
ghosts scatter away

a grey sky thickens
crowding out the weary sun
short days claim the land

echoes in the barn
once filled with the harvest song
mice inherit grain

candles in windows
guide the wanderer back home
against the long dark

the last leaf trembles
clinging to a crooked branch
before surrender

bonfire rising high
embers drift into the stars
smoke carries the past

owl across the field
silent wings disturb the night
eyes bright as lanterns

boots sink into mud
paths dissolve in endless rain
yet the heart goes on

stone bridge glistening
under a veil of cold mist
time flows underneath

fall moon at its peak
rides above the quiet hills
silver crowns the dark
