summit wrapped in cloud
stone shoulders bear the silence
sky leans close to earth

goats tread narrow paths
bells echo across the cliffs
music of the heights

snow crowns the ridges
unchanged through the shifting years
time frozen in stone

pine roots grip the rock
holding fast against the wind
life clings where it can

stream leaps from the ledge
shattering into the air
falling into mist

prayers tied with red thread
flutter on the mountain pass
words rise with the wind

shadow in the gorge
falcon circles patiently
waiting for the fall

glacier moves slowly
grinding secrets into dust
river born from ice

path of stone and dust
steps vanish into the clouds
pilgrims disappear

moss on granite walls
softens the stern ancient face
green beard of the rock

campfire on the ridge
its smoke joins the Milky Way
whispers into night

echo answers back
a second voice in the cliffs
loneliness undone

red sunrise breaking
over jagged silhouettes
mountains drink the light

yaks press through the snow
their breath hangs like frozen clouds
bells ring down the trail

lightning splits the peak
a crown of fire on stone
thunder shakes the world

wildflowers scatter
between the sharp mountain stones
color finds a way

ravens ride the gust
over ridges scarred with ice
dark scribes of the sky

summit winds are sharp
cutting skin with frozen blades
yet the heart feels warm

shepherd sings alone
his song drifts among the rocks
mountains echo back

long valleys below
patchwork fields of green and gold
seen from frozen heights

night cloaks the summit
stars gather on silent stone
mountain dreams of sky
