first cry splits the dawn
a new voice joins the chorus
world leans in to hear

buds pierce frozen ground
the garden exhales gently
green awakens slow

river finds its path
through the stones that once refused
patience carves the way

hatchling breaks the shell
sunlight pours into small eyes
sky becomes a home

hands cradle the flame
tiny candle in the dark
hope takes its first breath

raindrops kiss the soil
seed uncoils in trembling earth
roots taste life at last

infantâ€™s tiny hand
closes around a finger
grip of endless trust

morning spreads its wings
over rooftops wet with dew
day begins again

cocoon splits apart
wings painted with sudden light
butterfly ascends

a laugh never heard
springs from the mouth of a child
echoes bloom like song

clouds part for the sun
new warmth floods the waiting field
barley bends in thanks

stream gushes from ice
mountain heart beats once again
snow learns how to move

new star blinks awake
among the old constellations
time accepts the spark

foal stumbles upright
legs unsteady in the straw
life insists on steps

bell chimes in the square
welcoming a newborn soul
into woven streets

roots entwine the stone
sapling claims its rightful place
forest shifts in time

first words tumble out
awkward yet alive with sound
air becomes meaning

shells wash on the shore
inside each a tiny world
whispered into being

sunrise after storm
world feels cleaner, newly made
everything begins

first rain of the year
soaks the fields with innocence
earth drinks eagerly

new light in the eyes
mother sees the child within
and the world feels whole
