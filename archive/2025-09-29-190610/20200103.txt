crickets fade away
their chorus thins with the dusk
leaves answer instead

maple flames the hill
a thousand candles burning
in a single wind

geese form a sharp V
cutting across fading blue
journey etched in sky

fields stripped of their grain
rest beneath the silver moon
quiet after toil

woodsmoke threads the air
clinging to the farmer’s coat
evening grows closer

chestnuts crack and fall
the child gathers them quickly
pockets full of fire

river flows slower
mirroring a broken sky
scattered with red leaves

the scarecrow stands still
watching the empty furrows
arms heavy with dusk

persimmons hanging
lanterns on the darkened trees
sweetness waits for frost

a raven circles
calling down to yellow fields
echoes cross the vale

wind rattles the gate
each hinge sings of passing time
seasons shift again

frost creeps on the grass
like a secret confession
to the coming night

villagers gather
sharing rice and autumn songs
warmth in every voice

rain taps the window
a single candle answers
with its fragile flame

cobwebs on the barn
lace threaded with morning dew
diamonds in the chill

the mountain exhales
cool breath into the valley
smoke curls from the roofs

crimson river runs
where the maple’s tears have fallen
time dissolves in flow

a kite left behind
shreds slowly in autumn winds
colors fade to bone

lantern festival
children chase their glowing light
into falling dusk

pine needles scatter
across the forgotten trail
steps remember them

harvest moon ascends
illuminating silence
over resting fields
