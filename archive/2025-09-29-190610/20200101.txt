buds break through the frost
earth loosens its quiet grip
green breathes into air

petals drift slowly
on the still mirror of pond
circles widening

soft rain on the roof
awakens the sleeping seeds
dreams of blossoms rise

the sparrows chatter
building nests in bare branches
woven threads of dawn

a child’s kite ascends
into the pale springtime sky
colors chase the clouds

morning dew clings tight
to each blade of newborn grass
diamonds in sunlight

plum trees opening
a fragrance across the breeze
time folds into now

gentle warmth returns
as if the world remembered
its forgotten song

on the stone pathway
tiny moss begins to spread
green reclaiming grey

streamlets overflow
with laughter of melting snow
mountains send greetings

bamboo shoots emerge
breaking through the softened soil
hungry for the sun

a bell in the wind
rings above the temple gates
spring bows at the sound

wind across rice fields
carries whispers of sowing
old songs in the furrows

insects stir again
clattering beneath the leaves
small orchestra wakes

soft clouds drift apart
the pale horizon opens
to a tender blue

beneath cherry trees
footsteps scatter fallen pink
like memories gone

dandelion heads
scatter golden promises
into children’s hands

the rain is patient
teaching the earth to listen
drop by gentle drop

sunrise stretches long
shadows lean against the hills
light reclaims the night

farmers bend in rows
a chorus of planting hands
greeting the warm earth

spring moon on the lake
shivering with silver light
touches every wave
