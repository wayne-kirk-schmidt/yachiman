full moon on still lake
a second sky beneath waves
mirrors endless night

thin crescent rising
cuts a silver smile in dark
secrets softly held

moon climbs over roofs
casting shadows long and thin
streets breathe quietly

lantern in the sky
guiding fishermen at sea
home by silver light

frost glitters brighter
under the cold winter moon
ice learns how to shine

the owl lifts its wings
underneath the moonlit pines
eyes twin flames of gold

temple bells echo
moon hovers above the gate
listening in stone

clouds veil her pale face
yet the glow leaks through softly
like breath through curtains

wolf howls in the hills
answer drifts across valleys
moon listens, unmoved

on the riverbank
moonlight scatters like petals
floating with the tide

moonrise through the mist
mountains bow in silhouette
worship in silence

autumn harvest moon
hangs heavy with golden weight
fields glimmer with thanks

child points to the sky
asking if the moon can hear
answer is the glow

waning moon slips low
old companion growing thin
ready to depart

two lovers whisper
their words lost in open air
caught by the pale moon

icy mountain peak
reflects the sharp winter moon
stone becomes a lamp

seabirds wheel at night
their wings trace across the glow
ghosts of the water

thin clouds drifting fast
the moon breaks them into shreds
silver on tatters

paper lanterns rise
yet the moon outshines them all
one flame among stars

snowfield stretches wide
moonlight covers every hill
silence wrapped in white

the moon disappears
yet her pull remains in waves
absence still commands
