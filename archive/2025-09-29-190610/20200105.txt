waves fold into waves
endless conversations flow
language of the deep

salt upon my lips
gift of the restless shoreline
taste of wandering

the tide retreats slow
revealing forgotten shells
secrets left behind

distant fishing boats
their lanterns rise and vanish
stars upon the sea

storms carve the harbor
ropes straining against the masts
wood groans with the wind

foam dissolves to mist
on the black volcanic stones
breath of ancient fire

children chase the waves
feet soaked with sudden laughter
ocean pulls them back

seaweed clings tightly
to the rocks that never move
dancers of the tide

moon draws up the waves
like silver threads of water
woven into night

a gull takes its arc
cutting white across the blue
cry fades into sky

shimmering horizon
always a step beyond reach
promises of blue

sailors lift their nets
heavy with the weight of life
morning feeds the town

shipwreck bones remain
half-buried beneath the sand
rust sings to the tide

shells like tiny drums
beaten by the patient surf
hollow songs resound

whales breach far away
giants greeting distant kin
spray becomes rainbow

on the quiet pier
a fisherman mends his line
time tangles and flows

sunset on the bay
turns the waters into gold
then into silence

ocean smells of storms
carried in its endless breath
warning in the wind

anchors sink in sand
the ship rests against the tide
dreaming of the next

waves erase footprints
no path survives on the shore
only memory

the sea is endless
yet each wave has its own name
whispered to the sand
