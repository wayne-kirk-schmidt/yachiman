morning sky opens
painted in fragile pastels
dawn breathes quietly

storm clouds gather fast
folding shadows over fields
lightning waits its turn

the eagle ascends
climbing stairways of the wind
higher than the sun

thin clouds stretched like silk
pulled across a fading blue
threads of afternoon

rainbows arch the sky
bridge between the earth and dream
vanishing in mist

an airplane hums low
a small star among the clouds
carrying voices

sky holds the silence
after thunder disappears
emptiness remains

silver morning frost
sparkles under open sky
world beneath a dome

the horizon burns
sunset spilling over clouds
embers drift to night

shooting star falls quick
writing its brief fiery note
vanishing in dark

blue without ending
a canvas for swallows’ flight
ink of feather strokes

storm breaks overhead
sky shouts with electric fire
rain applauds the song

a hawk’s shadow drifts
measured against endless blue
smallness understood

grey veils of twilight
descend across open plains
the sky folds its wings

distant thunder rolls
carried by invisible hands
from mountains to sea

moonrise in the east
glows against the violet dusk
lantern of the sky

clouds drift like islands
ever-shifting continents
floating without maps

sky after the rain
washed clean of all memory
new light settles in

air balloons ascend
tiny globes in morning light
wanderers of sky

constellations turn
old myths whisper overhead
time flows with the stars

at the break of dawn
a single crow cuts the air
sky accepts its cry
