within the circle
woven carefully in plaits
are the threads of love

press forward and chase
the life the dream the passion
building your castles

we do know the time
of birth through life also death
when to embrace love

sparrows plaintive cry
reflects off stones across ponds
winter has arrived

dark red ink pooling
on pages newly written
to review our craft
