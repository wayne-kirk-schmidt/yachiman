the fresh beginnings
excite our hearts; revive souls
trading old for new

rushing through the light
we meet only once and part
both on a schedule

cannot see the end
and that is just fine to say
the play is the thing

once through the portal
do we remember crossing?
dimly if at all

the hammer strikes us
readying us for new things
and keeping secrets
