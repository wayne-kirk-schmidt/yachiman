strength in traditions
brown and faded, bright and new
patterns of belief

first-morning motion
a gesture of thankfulness
with water and fire

but we know the start
with breathing in and out life
pulsing to heartbeats

turn the lit corner
to see the family there
and then we are home

pay no attention
feeble outside distractions
focus then within
