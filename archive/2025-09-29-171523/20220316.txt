suddenly jolting
ground quivers in excitement
waking us from sleep

push the moments on
wishing justification
for long past disputes

footprints drying dark
in bright beaches on noonday
pointing to the sun

well I wonder then
did the past really tell us
what we need to know?

forgiveness is placed
at the feet, before the heart
easing memories
