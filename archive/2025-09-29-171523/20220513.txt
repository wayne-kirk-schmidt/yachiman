simple beads of sweat
dripping from the brow lightly
splash grey memories

flies born in summer
glide within autumn breezes
yet still in winter

discover sunrise
first grey, purple, orange, red
as the world slumbers

within dreams of mice
dance cheese inside warm burrows
far from watching cats

pen moves on paper
finds the will to chant in prose
of matters to me
