wet snow lightly falls
unsure, between drop and flake
much like us sometimes

bright definitions
colors, sounds, and sensations
swirl all around us

passions will claim us
dark storm clouds of anger or
gentle ray of love

within these moments
are all the time of the world
running down your cheek

should I wait for you?
now or later or never
will I remember?
