present in graveyards
are beauty and beginnings
wonderful mixture

growth entails work
discipline to transform us
based on our actions

the abbot whisks tea
and watches the swirls spinning
smiling at the zen

tenderly we touch
gently we create ideas
blooming into now

wishing for fingers
to count all the times we say
when we find comfort
