smallest grains falling
dancing between the heavens
till we flip the glass

and in a half place
exists castles of tomorrow
with yesterdays tombs

we can move oceans
see new possibilities
by pouring ourselves

moving through our life
like wearing different coats
steps celebrated

regard the math there
remove nothing take nothing
but achieve beauty
