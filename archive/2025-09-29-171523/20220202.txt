crunching underneath
snowflakes fall under the steps
within the white storm

cooling in the dawn
tea perspires pluming fragrance
delicious tastes steep

pen an ode to void
how do you address it then?
so you can greet it?

wind chilling the hands
stiffening the spine straight up
as I pedal on

hands grasp the green tree
as we brought it in for Yule
dazzling colors
