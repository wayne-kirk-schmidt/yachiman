first within the heart
then outside is where love starts
flowing and building

simple smiles warming
outside in the wet grey cold
as we walk inside

sitting at the bar
perfect and fiercely shining
capturing my eyes

hewn from white granite
proudly guarding our welfare
always come in twos

history does rhyme
trying verses and couplets
till the right one sticks
