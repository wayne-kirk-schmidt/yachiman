George sits down and laughs
enjoying his bright world filled
with two-year-old things

Your dreams start with love
adding in desires and hopes
garnishing with joy

go into water
to sit, and bathe, then recline
and reflect on life

peaches sliced broadly
arranged in patterns on plates
delicious to see

our blood is singing
within veins and arteries
listen to it's song
