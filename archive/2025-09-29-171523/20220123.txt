descending the depths
past meetings also partings
is the connection

the world slows right now
twitching also quivering
what is the next step?

strange how life links us
to others within ourselves
reflections of self

earn the truth each day
stand up for those who cannot
that wage is priceless

resting at the top
look at mountains and valleys
savoring the path
