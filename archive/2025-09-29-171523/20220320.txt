And we start again
building basics from the stones
recreating towers

chant chapter and verse
should we stick to ancient laws?
fulfill them anew?

first, follow the law
then learn and see how to change
finally, make new

change comes to us all
small at first later bigger
always becoming

art is seen by all
in largest and smallest things
showing mastery
