from early grey dawn
into gentle purple dusk
celebrating mom

dinner and wine done
walking home with a slight chill
may season teases

now that we should know
firsts; fire, language, wheel, and law
how the seeds blossomed

sampling and trying
from each subject building from
the prior foundations

bind the wounded hand
clutching all the sacred books
teaching about love
