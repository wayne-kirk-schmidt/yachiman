shock yourself today
stand on the edge of the sea
and listen to you

chalking the outline
of my soul in the wide world
filled in with white streaks

focus on the shrine
grey and gold in the morning
speaking with heaven

when we after all
get things right in small amounts
can we then do more

writing to myself
a letter I open in years
what will I tell me?
