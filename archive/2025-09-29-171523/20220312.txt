friendships built on threads
experience. understanding.
strong connections

our foundations are
who came before and who stayed
what they decided

simple cursive script
curling and twisting snake-like
tells us the story

white flakes and drops fall
deciding what to become
snow or something else

cold silently roars
while heat joyfully cackles
telling us stories
