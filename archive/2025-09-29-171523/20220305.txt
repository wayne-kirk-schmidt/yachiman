and we stop again
right in front of the same place
where we mourned prior

enriched by our love
the house turns into a home
nurturing us all

little things add up
account for a lot in us
with each choice and change

water stops flowing
waits for mere moments resting
before moving on

dust clings to our feet
from the path we took and take
silent testament
