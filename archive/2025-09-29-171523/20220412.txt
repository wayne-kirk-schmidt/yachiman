and it was then found
dusty and crumpled but whole
gleaming as souls do

horn and clarinets
can provide bright messages
balancing the drums

first state the message
repeat, transform and restate
each voice well-woven

notes touch and delight
the ears who pass them through gates
into our own hearts

simple lines describe
the wings the eyes the faces
heralds of heaven
