clinging to seaweed
populations of last year
drying in the sun

speeding through cities
footfalls raging on pavement
completing our goals

wet, small, and alone
seems the way that we all start
simple beginnings

quiet times quarry
our spiritual bedrock
yielding rare treasures

spilled on dark gravel
the waters of the river
painting the way home
