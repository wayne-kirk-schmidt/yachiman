I listened well and long
to the hearts and the spirits
the words of wisdom

slips of paper rest
on desks waiting eagerly
for the touch of pens

segmented passions
within us part this some that
blending into one

walking in silence
teaches the heart to be calm
beating in silence

present the question
phrase echoing from the walls
listen  to answers
