watching the shoreline
reclaim remains of the day
water slowly ebbs

pause to taste the wind
the snake slithering inside
captivates the eye

blooming with the dusk
shrinking with the stark morning
the iris dances

but where is the soul?
within the chest? somewhere else?
combined yet special

the dice clack and bounce
of walls and dirt heralding
the advent of fate
