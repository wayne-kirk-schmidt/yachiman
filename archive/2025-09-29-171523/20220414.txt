familiar warmth
spreading through our bones and skin
whispering at dawn

present with us now
fathers and mothers prior
standing with us all

pitched from the tall tree
come fledglings who quickly learn
the depth of the craft

ants move with purpose
seeking, probing, exploring
alone in vast hordes

with vegetables
and simple spices we make
a welcoming meal
