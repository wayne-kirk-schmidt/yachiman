and here we are now
within the mirror of us
looking at our faces

did you still live there?
mere blocks from that destruction?
or did you escape?

the rat ponders cheese
brown cheek pouches inflating
as she eats dinner

tossed and flung like toys
from vengeful angels bathtubs
ships perservering

simple scrapes on toast
of golden butter melting
morning rituals
