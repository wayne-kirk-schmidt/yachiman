how is fate expressed?
chiseled in foundations?
or strewn on rooftops?

horses stamp and sniff
at the morning air for clues
yearning to run free

birds swim in the wind
dive and rise effortlessly
celebrating life

paper torn in quarters
folded, crumpled, and scattered
still keeps the message

fruit in the daytime
freshly cut and in slices
arranged in circles
