landing on porch steps
snow swirls and circles around
gifts from the grey sky

driving the dark roads
winding tunnel of your path
plunges in unknown

divining portents
coming from the horizon
as stars start to fall

circling in the water
turtles from prior ages
slow steady motion

within in my dream
dolls cut from bed clothes stained blue
dance amid green flames
