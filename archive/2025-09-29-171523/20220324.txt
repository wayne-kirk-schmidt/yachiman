smoldering embers
fume, sputtering fading rage
slowly the fire dims

staring at black marks
we get lost in the numbers
best to see the page

but then when we sing
weave audio tapestries
notes fading away

shuffling footsteps
speak of age or speak of grace?
as we pirouette

every age must
view their gardens and water
personal passions
