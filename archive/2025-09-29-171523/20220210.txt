what was your true name?
that outlined and described you
before you were born?

presenting myself
again before a mirror
reflecting true self

I watch the seconds
turn into minutes and hours
encompassing life

within the bridges
lie strength, belief, and valor
whittled from raw stone

from the marble dust
settling around the new sculpture
gifting it with life
