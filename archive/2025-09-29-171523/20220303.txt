just before midnight
quietly filling the heart
with special new dreams

quickly the heart heals
forgetting the agony
letting ache subside

as light touched your face
dimly in the evening
halo of beauty

can we look down then?
to see what and who remains?
across those bridges?

the best times in life
unscripted. emotional.
pure celebration
