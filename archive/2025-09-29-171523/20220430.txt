throw the stone across
laughing water quivering
quiet joy ringing

each stage of my life
is built on the prior work
each within others

it is good and fine
healing sometimes means some loss
to say goodbye well

bless each of the steps
muddy, dry, freezing, scorching
so that we make more

five seven and five
bracketing observations
shorter, long, then back
