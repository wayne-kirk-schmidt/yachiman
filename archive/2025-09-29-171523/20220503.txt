voices and replies
echoing within hallways
stirring memory

rescuing the lives
rays of hope glittering bright
dotting landscapes

did memory fade?
did distraction blur focus?
away from purpose

the first motion slow
but builds on every step
weaving successes

what things should we do?
that lingers? that clings to life?
love. charity. faith.
