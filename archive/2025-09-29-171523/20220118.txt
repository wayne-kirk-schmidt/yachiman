playing in the sea
study vocabulary
of the blue water

the force of the blast
was felt long ago in the soul
you can still see ash

what I want to hear?
from others? from you? from me?
that we forgive us

moving among clouds
whispers of truth collecting
falls gently as rain

divisions in clay
shaped and smoothed guided with love
to build the vessel
