nothing like right now
cleaning glass removing grime
light shining inside

spaces shift and move
accomodating ourselves
as we are right now

motion flickered once
in the eyeblink and was gone
candlelight glowing

what can be the goal?
of a life and of a faith?
embrace and love all.

looking for small glass,
that, when combined, can become
beautiful murals
