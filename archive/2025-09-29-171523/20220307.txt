as we regard blood
within us and among us
binding and flowing

boats tossing around
persistently and wildly
in desperation

once the water goes
receding pulling wreckage
silent twigs dripping

could we have seen this?
nature itself is silent
except to then roar

shadows of time hide
stately birds of yesterday
hidden by grey skies
