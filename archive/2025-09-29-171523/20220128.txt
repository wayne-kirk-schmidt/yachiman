progressing slowly
but surely describing arcs
hot white sands dancing

bullfrogs talking slow
within a June sultry day
croaking summer songs

black splashes across
synchronized to the rhythm
giving stark white life

smoking brown and burnt
turning grey then dark then cold
incense sends prayers

green exploding wide
with excitement and new life
with spring promises
