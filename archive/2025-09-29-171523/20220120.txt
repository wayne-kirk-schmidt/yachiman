searching memory
we find jewels and dark storms
treasuring moments

stewing quietly
broth builds from steeping flavors
like love, taking time

cantankerous men
tottering across green parks
arguing loudly

Lorenzo the cat
lounges warmly in the sun
dreaming of fresh fish

the soul of a dog
contains all grand adventures
that tickle the nose
