water falling gluts
the rivers with brimming life
in a wild torrent

present it to us
the time the effort the sight
and we will bless it

sliding on the ice
sudden motion carrying
swiftly on white paths

after the fires quit
ashes crumbled in grey dust
husks smoking lightly

move forward in life
we see ourselves in ourselves
as life moves in us
