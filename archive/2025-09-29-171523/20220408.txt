twilight blesses us
with quiet contemplation
all this when we sleep

quiet ringing tones
float from the brass gently struck
in the gray morning

was there some scripture?
the outlines the path to void?
or is it within?

swaying gently down
bamboo gleams with new moonlight
within the silence

stones are piled atop
the ruins of walls and roadways
new composting old
