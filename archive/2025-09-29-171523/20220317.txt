moving back and forth
in our life. in our own mind.
scrolls being reread

but running through it
counting all the poems I smile
we will excel now

flitting from shadows
speeding toward white-hot bonfires
the edge of dusk waits

with the first water
frigid numbing fingertips
in the summer air

green so deep it hurts
bleeding from the trees in fountains
geysers of pure growth
