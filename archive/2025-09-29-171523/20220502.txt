holidays scamper
within laughter lit hallways
joyful yet too brief

clear morning mist moves
along ridges. through the pines.
as we run the trail

message delivered
stinging yet still refreshing
clears the mind sharply

the message of love
still stands, still waits, still believes
and is delivered

the price of a life?
is the participation
simply powerful
