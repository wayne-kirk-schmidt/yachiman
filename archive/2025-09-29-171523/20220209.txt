placing the fingers
within the soul of the world
spread to find meaning

writing epistles
to unknown generations
with future lessons

creativity;
is inspiration constant?
no. it ebbs and flows.

I would build a world
within my own. special. rare.
helping others see

segmented steaming
pies fresh new from the baking
promise of delights
