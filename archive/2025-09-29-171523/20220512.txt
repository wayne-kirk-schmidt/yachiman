push with the new heart
against old iron tired brass
and they will yield then

brown leaves faltering
from autumn to winter then
spring green leaves blossom

can we push heaven?
and have it do our bidding?
no. cooperate.

whales and fish from deep
swimming circles looking up
within dark waters

the flute retains sound
played long ago and captured
in the instrument
