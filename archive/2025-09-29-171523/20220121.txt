floating notes hanging
sorrowfully extending
framing perception

fluttering themes dance
droning to some, to others
the most delicate

we wish for blessings
from others and from heaven
from us most of all

cantilevering
we shift and sort by ourselves
searching for balance

note the location
it will change and we will change
therein lies beauty
