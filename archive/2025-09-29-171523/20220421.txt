across white tables
follow meeting checkerboards
paper water pen

press the flower firm
within the journal today
capturing the day

no, we cannot stop
looking after we started
in the fields today

green clover and bluegrass
wave shyly at my footsteps
as I run homeward

black buggies rolling
leisurely yet with purpose
seeking simple life
