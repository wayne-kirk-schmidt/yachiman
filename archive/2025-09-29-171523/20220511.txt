moving into light
from deep darkness stuns our eyes
yet fades in seconds

match dies guttering
flame, then spark, then smoke floating
from the silent wood

we could not have guessed
nature of love; affection
loyalty within

dust will always come
sprinkling around old corners
showing age in motes

it is the balance
keeps the buddha sitting straight
and powers the monk
