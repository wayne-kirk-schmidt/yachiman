we move ahead then
become stronger even still
only if we wish

bread sighs and rises
basking in warmth from the kiln
crisping yellow-brown

solitary rose
stands in the vase and shows us
snapshot of beauty

visit the dream sea
heaving and surging in time
with our gentle rest

first morning seconds
grey turns red turns yellow then
bursts into daylight
