twisting through sunlight
dust settles on golden beams
slow afternoon dance

composing stillness
within each ripple spreading
calming the center

flipping the pages
skim along feverishly
searching for answers

keep the flame alive
through life through birth and through death
kindling connections

alphabet letters
in special recitation
outlining our lives
