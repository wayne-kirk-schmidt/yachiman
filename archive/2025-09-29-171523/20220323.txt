and from woven threads
cloth billowing in the sun
comforting us all

now we work to close
the swinging gates in our minds
and move to purpose

moths and butterflies
flutter and move in the wind
elegant motion

we look for meaning
in morning, in evening
in the frosted pane

remove all the stains
and then will the soul be clean?
does it remember?
