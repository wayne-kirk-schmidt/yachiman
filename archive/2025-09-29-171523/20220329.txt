what is there to see?
within the whole of the world
seen within sunsets?

following web strands
crystal beads dew bright shining
in the early dawn

I want the future
married with present and past
in a single day

ghosts softly treading
on wood and stone, earth below
flowing through dark trees

ancient and burnished
glinting with holy purpose
the sword rests enshrined
