within the morning
orange-yellow sunbeams push
through the sleepy clouds

bread bakes in silence
yet listen well! it whispers
"very soon we are done"

dancing and weaving
child and adult both twirling
alone in the room

I walked through forests
welcoming purple green smells
that tickled my soul

and when we are five
see more than when we are two
while dreaming of more
