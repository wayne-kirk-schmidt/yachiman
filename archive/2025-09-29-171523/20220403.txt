standing and laughing
at comedy, we see each day
helps us be human

approach each sunrise
embrace possibility
as we move onwards

cleaning a courtyard
sweeping remains, washing stones
just like memories

echoes reflecting
jumping between the dark stones
within ears and minds

at first, the theme starts
then voices gradually join
building tapestries
