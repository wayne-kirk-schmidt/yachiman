first kiss caresses
the cheek seeking now the heart
smiling as warmth spreads

little blue robin
can I understand your speech
up there in the trees?

softly padding feet
mark the path from play to mom
to rest and be loved

I marvel at us
nearsighted to daily pain
unless it is ours

write discoveries
on paper, your heart and stone
so others may learn
