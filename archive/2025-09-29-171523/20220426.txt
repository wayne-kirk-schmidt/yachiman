something moving now
within the bag within me
bustling and writhing

what could this then be?
each brick supports more
in russet forests

the flame gutters once
flashing into smoke roiling
up into nothing

bathe in cold water
chills the body waking us
pleasant morning shocks

second hands racing
minute hands waltz serenely
while hours march onward
