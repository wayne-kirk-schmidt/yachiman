working in gardens
planting seeds and pruning trees
create green wonders

something stirs within
is it ache? is it longing?
something old and wise

presenting darkness
receding in the bright dawn
illumination

we ate the apple
enjoying first bite to last
unaware of time

sword extended out
gleaming and burnished shining
sadly bars the way
