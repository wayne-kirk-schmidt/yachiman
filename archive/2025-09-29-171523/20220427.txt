folded crisply white
gleaming so brilliantly
clothes as well as shrouds

footsteps in the sand
freshly wet in the morning
freshly cool on skin

what are you seeking?
is it heaven? is it bliss?
or is it yourself?

when we face the breeze
fresh smells and sharp sounds coming
straightway from our past

take this in today
turning the corner quickly
shadows fading fast
