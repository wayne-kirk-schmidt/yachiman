silver and bronze bells
serenade with deep voices
throughout the daytime

not that we know it
but we connect with others
and they also us

simple letters show
steps in reason paths in faith
within the same book

trust is developed
through simple action and faith
success breeds success

and we now are six
we have grown more and know more
yet still beginning
