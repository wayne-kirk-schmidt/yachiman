in the heart itself
beating and pulsing wetly
red dancing with blue

lonely tubes ringing
sadly chiming hymns to now
after the first

try all life dishes
savoring the tastes each time
enjoying the meal

watch the string moving
quivering now with purpose
moving in the sun

leaves on the branches
turning blue becoming green
colors moving slow
