ebbing and flowing
water also interest
sustaining our lives

I rearrange blocks
entranced by colors and shapes
I move them again

shadows will bestow
blessings and forgetfulness
helping weary souls

push past the limits
walls we erect to guide us
so we can then stretch

I have read scriptures
though the best true path teachings
are simple actions
