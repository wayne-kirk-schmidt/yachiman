remembering love
while at the gates of Heaven
enriching our faith

memories hold us
celebrating time's passage
enriching the soul

blessings of the moon
outline roads envelope houses
for just a few hours

delicious water
reminding we are also
part of simple thing

the monk rests a bit
smiling at the morning sun
changing the shadows
