up to date or not
our work still carries onwards
devoted to tasks

routines and patterns
can be cages or roadways
understand them well

can a scroll rewind?
reforming the characters
would we want it so?

choices are crossroads
decisions propel onwards
preparing for more

mirrors are loving
showing us who we are now
and without judgement
