thrown into ponds
stones sink swallowing the dark
becoming the depths

little spiders play
jumping and hopping on webs
ropes in the sunshine

the very breath where
you realize love has gone wrong
stings and yet cleanses

first glimpse of love
from new eyes just now opened
carries heavens song

and when we finish
and complete our tasks, lay down tools
await for next steps
