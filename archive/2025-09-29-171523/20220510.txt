along the river
turtles and herons bathing
green, white, and blue lines

special notes linger
within our dreams sung before
reminds us of home

I want to see you
the way heaven looks at you
both pure and mud mixed

continue to speak
to me about me in my speech
within my warm heart

we go back again
to home to love to caring
for every day
