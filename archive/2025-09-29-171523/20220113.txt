within our journey
glimpse love and hope in flashes
wonderful rare blooms

all I want to see
people embracing changes
celebrating life

we can push the world
in short steps with hopeful hearts
as we improve us

can it really be
thin threads weave into large ropes
and raise massive beams

frozen statues stare
east and west at another
guarding the pathways
