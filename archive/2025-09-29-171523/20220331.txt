reflected on ponds
morning sun rays glint coldly
small icy rainbows

three blue one grey
stones piled; silent pyramids
marking the pathway

fire clinging to leaves
dancing along their edges
green, red, then to ash

green patches shining
flowers silent and thriving
amidst the rubble

fading, fluttering
pink blooms signaling an end
and a beginning
