the rabbit and the owl
staring from across the field
within the morning

digging down deeply
search for food and meaning
roots entwine and grow

inhale, then exhale
air so coldly crisp it hurts
amidst the white plains

embers will linger
and it, much like memory
smolders with past love

heads hit our pillows
and the dreams saunter right in
dazzling the sleepers
