what do letters mean?
before they became letters?
they were a longing

cupped in silver
dribbling liquid slowly down
blessing and washing

tunnels comfort us
safe, warm, dark, and inviting
but they hold us back

corn tassels wave gold
within huge oceans of green
in the autumn sun

friends who have moved on
do they know about us here?
traveling onward
