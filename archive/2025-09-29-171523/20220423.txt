dreams walk up to you
beckoning and whispering
on paths yet unknown

monsters and horrors
reflected in the right mirrors
gleaming as angels

watching our breathing
in. out. always repeating
striving for balance

the key is balance
in sculpture, scripture, practice
the middle pathway

diamonds shine showing
eightfold pathways within us
our obligation
