each step we progress
building our understanding
enjoying new things

our concentration
built daily; refined, polished
fluid-like sand dunes

the forest edges wait
welcoming all who enter
to rest and just be

each plank and each stone
lends strength within a chorus
singing of our home

warmth trickling in
slides past the cold's sharp edges
spring gathering strength
