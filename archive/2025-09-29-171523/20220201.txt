each move to God's love
each droplet then combining
into an ocean

will we meet again?
on different welcome shores
to talk of new hope

letters from before
composed with care and loving
newly discovered

watch the horizon
for storms for ships returning
out of fading sun

the soles of my shoes
can recall with joy each trip
from our adventures
