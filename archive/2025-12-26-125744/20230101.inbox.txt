Warm air moves softly
Wind bending tall summer grass
The long day slows down
###
Green fields drink the rain
Heat presses down on the land
The night comes within slow
###
Summer solstice burns
Parents share a last small laugh
Inside feels warm now
###
build me a castle
within my heart lined with strength
and festooned with age
###
faint night
bell closes through night
night unmoving
