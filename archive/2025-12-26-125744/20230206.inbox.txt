summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through footsteps
time listening pauses,
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through new year
time pauses, listening
###
pattering down quickly
simple thirds and fifths playing
in the bright hallways
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
