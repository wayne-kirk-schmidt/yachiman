summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
leans leans leaf silence
slips slips early dim distant
faint folds leans snow soft
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
