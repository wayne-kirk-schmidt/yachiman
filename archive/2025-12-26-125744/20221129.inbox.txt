Summer rain begins
Wind bending tall summer grass
night The comes in slow
###
comfort or conceal
what is better? what is worse?
try all and then see
###
Cold water on stone
Water carries ancient prayers
Water keeps its way
###
now that we are five
we nurture secret places
revel and in friends
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
