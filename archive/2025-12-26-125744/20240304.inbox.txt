mountains lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
early path holds pale
narrow lingers opens bare
soft rises echo
###
windows lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
lantern late silence
late stone valley ember still
distant folds dim waits
###
distant birds
echo fades through birds
birds at rest
