Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Warm air moves softly
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The long day slows down
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Wind bending tall summer grass
Heat starts to drift off
###
Green fields drink the rain
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Light grows soft again
