summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
Autumn leaves drift down
Baby sleeps, fists uncurled
Thoughts feel awake now
###
pale water late slow
breaks leans folds empty rises
wanders lingers leans
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
