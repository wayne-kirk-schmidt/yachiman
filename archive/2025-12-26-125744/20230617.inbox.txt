Bright sun warms the stone
Wind moves across open fields
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog slithers between dark trees
Day slips into rest
###
Cold stone by the stream
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Faith stays unbroken
###
Cold prayer in winter
Prayer moves through frozen air
Water keeps its way
###
Cold stone by the stream
Prayer moves through frozen air
Winter does not speak
