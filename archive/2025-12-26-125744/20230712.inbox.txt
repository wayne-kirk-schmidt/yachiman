path lingers distant
breaks cold ember silence faint
closes warm signal
###
quiet doors
light wanders through doors
doors returns
###
Flame leans into night
Kami wait in cedar shade
Season turns twice now
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
