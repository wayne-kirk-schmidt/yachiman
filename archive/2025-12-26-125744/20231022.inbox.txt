Ice cracks on the pond
A prayer rises with incense
Autumn lingers here
###
leaf narrow closes
water winter bare closes
ember bare quiet waits
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
breaking small circles
signaling snow and wind soon
narrow silence cold
