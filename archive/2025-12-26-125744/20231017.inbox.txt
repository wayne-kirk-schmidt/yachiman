summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
warm doors
ember fades through windows
fingerprints breathing
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through mountains
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
