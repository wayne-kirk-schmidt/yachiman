faint mountains
wave leans through mountains
new years returns
###
dawn and fireplace
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
early dawn
wood closes through heaven
trees at rest
###
pale circles breaks late
early lingers slow distant
cold stone waits wind birth
