narrow morning
path drifts through morning
morning unmoving
###
forests lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
dim slow settles mist
circles ridge rises leans soft
settles ember slips
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
