noon and night
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
Autumn leaves drift down
Smoke trails into starry dark
Mind settles down now
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
