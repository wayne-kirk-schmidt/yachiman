slow fall
iron circles through sun
fall unmoving
###
fireplace lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
settles quiet shore cold
fades passes breaks circles
slow ember ember
###
beach lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through rivers
time pauses, listening
