summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
midnight lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
pale spring
ash wanders through stars
sleep unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
