Summer rain begins
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The heat loosens grip

Summer rain begins
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Evening slowing down
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Fog slithers between dark trees
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Heat presses down on the land
Heat starts to drift off
