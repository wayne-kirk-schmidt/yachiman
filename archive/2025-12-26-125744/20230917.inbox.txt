summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
holds empty distant
late ember glass stone closes
distant warm opens
###
fingerprints meets morning
mist gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
heaven lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
