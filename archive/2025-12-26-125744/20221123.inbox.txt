what is the smallest
things to fulfill our base needs?
sometimes best to ask
###
dancing regally
acting out our pain and joy
on a stage all see
###
When we would look down
At the tombstone and chuckle
They were never there
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift doors through
time pauses, listening
###
dust showers slightly
sifting over possessions
blessing from ages
