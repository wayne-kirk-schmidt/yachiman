summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows through drift trees
time pauses, listening
###
empty valley drifts
settles doors slides slips dim
snow narrow early
###
Summer rain begins
Light shifts over the water
Warm air comes to rest
