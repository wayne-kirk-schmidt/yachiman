Frozen river bends
God listens without reply
The water moves
###
Cold prayer in winter
Stone remembers falling snow
Winter does not speak
###
Winter water flows
Water slips past silent stone
Stillness endures
###
Stone river in frost
Prayer moves through frozen air
Stillness endures
###
God waits in silence
Prayer moves through frozen air
Stillness endures
