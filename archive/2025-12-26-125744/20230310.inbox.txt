empty wind ember
footprint ridge early empty
leans opens ridge slips
###
fog lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
But to live we eat
To work we will sweat and ache
And these truths keep us
###
Green fields drink the rain
Wind moves across open fields
The heat loosens grip
###
dust clings to our feet
from path the we took and take
silent testament
