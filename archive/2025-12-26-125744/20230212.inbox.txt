Morning crowd arrives,
coffee warms the restless hands,
trains move into day.
###
glass rises opens
quiet glass path distant settles
cold glass slips rises
###
the fine wine ages
on the shelf and in the cup,
within us also
###
slow windows
leaf holds windows through
windows at rest
###
slow down and realize
each step and breath each moment
is a victory
