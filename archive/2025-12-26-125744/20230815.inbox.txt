summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
faint rivers
paper lingers through rivers
afternoon returns
###
fades folds late still
holds ridge drifts narrow heavy
slips lingers circles
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
