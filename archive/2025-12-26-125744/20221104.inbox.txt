summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
shore opens quiet folds
glass ridge slips opens shore slips
valley snow cold breaks
###
Data in flight, at rest
Dancing, changing in safety
Fluidly marks time
###
a kite still flying
long after children the slept
wind plays on its own
###
ridge quiet signal soft
leaf dim path drifts drifts passes
distant empty still
