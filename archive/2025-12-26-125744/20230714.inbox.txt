late wind still narrow
narrow circles path folds snow
water stone waits slips
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
Summer solstice burns
Parents share a last small laugh
Inside feels warm now
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
