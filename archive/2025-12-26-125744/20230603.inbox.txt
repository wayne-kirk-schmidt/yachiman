Green fields drink the rain
Fog drifts across the valley
Heat starts to drift off
###
Hot pavement steams now
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Warm air comes to rest
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The night comes in slow
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Heat presses down on the land
Evening slowing down
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Heat presses down on the land
Light grows soft again
