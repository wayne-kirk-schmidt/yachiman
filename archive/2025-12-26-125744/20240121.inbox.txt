summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
path wind drifts rises
waits fades echo faint ridge
cold passes slips wave
###
stars lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
pale rain
clock circles through doors
doors returns
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
