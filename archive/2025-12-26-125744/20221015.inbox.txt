summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
package that passion
into a purpose pushing
the best performance
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through birth
time listening pauses,
###
breathes summer softly
night shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
briefly when we rest
we see ghosts of momentum
coming up to us
