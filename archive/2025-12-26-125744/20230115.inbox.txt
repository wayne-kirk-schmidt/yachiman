lovers of changes
seek secrets faintly hinting
the of new bright world
###
not all hands touch that
have love abiding inside
proceed with caution
###
Fireplace grows dim,
embers curl in dying light,
smoke threads into night.
###
now I speak with me
instructing and listening
hesitation no
###
narrow fall
iron opens through windows
winter alone
