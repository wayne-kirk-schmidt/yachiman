summer lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
warm rises circles
shore pale footprint folds snow wave
drifts settles wanders
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
cold fireplace
ember holds through fireplace
fireplace alone
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
