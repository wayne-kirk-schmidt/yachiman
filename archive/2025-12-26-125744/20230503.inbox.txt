Quiet lake reflects
Heat presses down on the land
Light grows soft again
###
Warm air moves softly
Wind bending tall summer grass
The long day slows down
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
The long day slows down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind bending tall summer grass
Time eases its hold
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Evening slowing down
