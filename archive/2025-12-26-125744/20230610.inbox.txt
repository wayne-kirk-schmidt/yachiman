Green fields drink the rain
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The night comes in slow
###
Hot pavement steams now
Heat presses down on the land
Light grows soft again
###
Warm air moves softly
Wind bending tall summer grass
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Time eases its hold
###
Warm air moves softly
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
