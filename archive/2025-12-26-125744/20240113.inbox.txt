summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
moon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
heavy mist
echo settles through night
mist breathing
###
slides heavy dim
stone rises footprint faint soft
ember shadow warm
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
