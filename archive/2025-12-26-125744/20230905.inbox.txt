summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
rain lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
Forest breathes in mist
Birds stitch their songs through thin fog
Stars wait above us
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
