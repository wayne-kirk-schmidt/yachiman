slips wave quiet wanders
signal opens soft closes
quiet path narrow holds
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
wanders still empty
rises footprint rises breaks
signal settles still
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
distant rain
echo breaks through rain
rain at rest
