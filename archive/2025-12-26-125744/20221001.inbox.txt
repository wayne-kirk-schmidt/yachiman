push past the limits
we walls erect to guide us
so we can then stretch
###
shore snow folds footprint
passes late narrow fades
water closes slips
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
summer softly breathes
mist shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
