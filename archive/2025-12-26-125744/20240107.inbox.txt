Roads shine after rain
Kami wait in cedar shade
Clouds pass below us
###
jinja (shinto temple) and beach
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
windows lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through oceans
time pauses, listening
