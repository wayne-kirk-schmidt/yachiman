summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
Waves lean on the shore
Fire sings in orange tongues
Silence feels full now
###
Heaven feels so near
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Footprints fade out now
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
slips waits leaf late pale
signal waits circles stone quiet
warm folds ember path
