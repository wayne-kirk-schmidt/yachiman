quiet winter
wind breaks through birth
windows breathing
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
footsteps lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
ridge forests early
wanders leans cold warm empty
fades opens bare
