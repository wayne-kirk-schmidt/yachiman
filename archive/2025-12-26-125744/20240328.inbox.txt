slow settles quiet glass
still wave still signal path waits
distant dim folds drifts
###
spring and birthday
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
early night
clock drifts through night
night breathing
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
