Frozen river bends
Water carries old prayers
Winter does not speak
###
Frozen river bends
Prayer moves through frozen air
Silence answers back
###
Cold water on stone
Stone remembers falling snow
Faith stays unbroken
###
Stone river in frost
Stone remembers falling snow
Silence answers back
###
God walks winter paths
Cold hands touch running water
Winter does not speak
