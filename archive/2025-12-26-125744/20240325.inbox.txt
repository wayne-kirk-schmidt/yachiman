distant pale silence
leaf shadow glass distant late
ridge late lantern warm
###
soft new years
ash waits through new years
new years returns
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
