fireplace and sun
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
valley leans empty
folds shadow pale folds valley
folds wind pale empty
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
dim sun
stone waits through sun
trees at rest
