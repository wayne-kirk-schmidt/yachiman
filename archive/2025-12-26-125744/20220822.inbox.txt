summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Wind bending tall summer grass
Day slips into rest
###
dark water moving
as the rains come showering
within that torrents
###
what was it about?
the half-remembered spark flaring
into dull anger
###
breathes summer softly
midnight shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
