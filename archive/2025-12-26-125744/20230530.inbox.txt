Thin fog drifts at dawn
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Light grows soft again
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Rain moves across still water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Hot pavement steams now
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The night comes in slow
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Fog slithers between dark trees
The long day slows down
###
Green fields drink the rain
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Evening slowing down
