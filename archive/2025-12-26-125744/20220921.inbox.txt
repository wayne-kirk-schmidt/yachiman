soft midnight
thread closes through morning
morning returns
###
Ashes mark the path,
where the bonfire once had roared,
now that silence stays.
###
Burnt paper drifts high,
letters lost to summer fire,
words become the sky.
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
breathes summer softly
forests shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
