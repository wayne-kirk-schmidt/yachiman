summer breathes softly
fog drift shadows through moon
time pauses, listening
###
divining portents
coming from the horizon
as stars start to fall
###
shout out all the names!
of those who passed before us
who deserve our thanks
###
shore pale valley dim
still bare soft drifts slow settles
leans pale early slips
###
attaching the threads
of our lives to our dreams
both are used to weave
