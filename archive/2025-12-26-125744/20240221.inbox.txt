summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
warm birds
breath slides through birds
birds at rest
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
breaks folds pale ember
wind opens slow still breaks snow
settles slips dim wave
