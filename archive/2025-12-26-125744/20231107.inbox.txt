summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
slow midnight
shadow lingers through midnight
sleep returns
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
Rocks sleep in cold shade
Rivers braid through stones and reeds
Steps find their way home
