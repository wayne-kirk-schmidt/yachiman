slow wave footprint slips
signal passes empty fall
wave wind wind settles
###
night lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
faint night
bell closes through night
night unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
###
slow wind quiet cold faint
wanders holds circles ridge shore
silence opens breaks
