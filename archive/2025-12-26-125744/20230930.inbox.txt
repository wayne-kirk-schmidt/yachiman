lantern ridge water
settles soft waits drifts signal
footprint wanders pale
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
cold sun
light settles through sun
sun unmoving
###
glass ridge settles wave
closes bare fades leaf quiet
doors silence passes
