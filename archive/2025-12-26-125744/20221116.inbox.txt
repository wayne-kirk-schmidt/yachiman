afternoon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
snow falling outside
silently roars in mountains
mutely echoing
###
filling out our hearts
with hopes and dreams burning bright
attracting new friends
###
we build new castles
out of of ice, sand, of brick
fleetingly serene
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
