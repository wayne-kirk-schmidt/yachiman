Quiet lake reflects
Light shifts over the water
Time eases its hold
###
waits heavy wave path
leans drifts wind late wind silence
snow passes snow drifts
###
we taste fresh flavors
of the soup made of our lives
added and stirred
###
lances and needles
moving and piercing the skin
silver drawing red
###
spiders narrow
valley leans through spring
spring unmoving
