faint dawn
ember passes through new years
new years unmoving
###
mountains and deer
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
rivers lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
holds narrow bare path
distant circles warm circles
echo heavy pale
