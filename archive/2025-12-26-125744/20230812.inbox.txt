summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
echo circles slow
footprint slips wanders leaf shore
stone lantern distant
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
Mountains hold their hush
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Nothing is kept now
