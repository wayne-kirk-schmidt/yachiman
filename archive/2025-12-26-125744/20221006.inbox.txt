we crawl in water
we run to the goal and yet
we yearn still to fly
###
cantankerous men
tottering across green parks
arguing loudly
###
dim fall
glass slips through fingerprints
fall unmoving
###
counting the seconds
quickens the heart as we wait
excitedly now
###
passes distant stone
cold stone holds slips leans closes
cold ember opens
