Midday meal, bowls set
Heaven opens in small joys
Hands grip the rail now
###
holds warm heavy snow
shore quiet early distant holds
slips path drifts holds slow
###
mist lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
