small deer nod their heads
and push and shove for crackers
messengers of gods
###
making a present
of the lives we live each day
offering that up
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
what I swore to do
to heaven so long ago
defines me today
###
faint birthday
snow slides through birthday
birthday unmoving
