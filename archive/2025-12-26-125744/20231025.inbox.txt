warm noon
iron passes through rain
rain breathing
###
faint footsteps
light wanders through winter
footsteps at rest
###
moon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
glass valley mountains
water soft wave echo cold
ember snow signal
###
mist lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
