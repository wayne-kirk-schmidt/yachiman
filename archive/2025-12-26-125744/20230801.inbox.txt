summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
Midday meal, bowls set
Sea salt stays on tired skin
Season turns twice now
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
closes glass distant
warm valley lantern lantern
echo wave rises
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through trees
time pauses, listening
