first wishes and dreams
then we turn towards doing
in pursuit of dreams
###
breathes summer softly
mountains shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
Spring equinox dawns
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Boots slow their pace now
###
quiet oceans
shore slips through rain
rain returns
###
summer lingers
quiet breath within borrowed light
sleep turns the page
