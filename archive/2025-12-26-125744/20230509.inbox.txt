Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Heat starts to drift off
###
Quiet lake reflects
Light shifts over the water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Green fields drink the rain
Wind moves across open fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hold
###
Summer rain begins
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Heat starts to drift off
