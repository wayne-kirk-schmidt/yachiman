dust lies in the hall
comfortable serene and
the remnants of skin
###
Warm moves air softly
Wind moves across open fields
Light grows soft again
###
summer breathes softly
spring drift shadows through fog
time pauses, listening
###
storm breaks overhead
sky shouts with electric fire
rain applauds the song
###
small and thin sliver
changes and moves over time
become large and round
