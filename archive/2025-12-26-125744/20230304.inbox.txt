dim lantern ember
quiet folds wind rises closes
dim valley path bare
###
wolf howls in that hills
answer drifts across valleys
moon listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
###
breathes summer softly
dawn shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
ridge bare empty drifts
pale drifts valley wanders leaf
shadow ember birds
