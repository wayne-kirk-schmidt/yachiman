prayer is focus
within, outside, and around
balancing ourselves
###
stage each of my life
is built on the prior work
each within others
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Fog drifts across the valley
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
change comes to us all
small at first later bigger
always becoming
