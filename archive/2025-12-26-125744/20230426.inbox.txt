Soft mist lifts again
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Warm air comes to rest
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Wind bending tall summer grass
Light grows soft again
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Wind bending tall summer grass
The long day slows down
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Shadows stretch at dusk
