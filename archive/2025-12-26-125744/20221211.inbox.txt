summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
look we for meaning
in morning, in evening
in the frosted pane
###
faint rabbits
thread drifts through rabbits
breathing afternoon
###
Smoke curls from the pyre,
ashes drift to greet the dawn,
sunrise takes them home.
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
