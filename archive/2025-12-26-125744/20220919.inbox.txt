warm sleep
path lingers through footsteps
sleep breathing
###
leaf fades dim leaf
narrow early drifts pale leans
wave lantern dim stone
###
Summer rain begins
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The heat loosens grip
###
lake Quiet reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
Time eases its hold
###
distant beach
ember circles through beach
beach at rest
