quiet footprint water
silence drifts breaks silence holds
empty ember leaf
###
Morning light returns
Rain drums on roof and window
Stories return now
###
leaf signal snow soft
closes morning lantern soft
slow rises wanders
###
heaven lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
