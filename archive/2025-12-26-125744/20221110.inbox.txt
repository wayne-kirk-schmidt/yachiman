summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
spiders lingers
breath quiet in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
snow crowns the ridges
unchanged through the shifting years
time frozen in stone
###
ducklings assembling
within the cold pond swimming
beautiful at dawn
