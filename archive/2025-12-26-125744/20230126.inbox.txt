empty fingerprints
iron drifts through fingerprints
fingerprints breathing
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through oceans
pauses, time listening
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
fingerprints and deer
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
Oni grin at gates
Moon hangs above sleeping roofs
leans Time forward now
