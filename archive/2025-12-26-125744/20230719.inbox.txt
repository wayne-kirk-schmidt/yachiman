narrow afternoon
breath breaks through afternoon
afternoon alone
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
moon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
trees and forests
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
