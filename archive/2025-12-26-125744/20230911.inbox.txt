heavy valley warm
fades footprint still narrow
lantern stone footprint
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
Morning light returns
Roads lead past fields into dusk
Breath turns to smoke now
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
