summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
shore valley pale dim
still bare soft drifts slow settles
leans pale early slips
###
distant sun
clock leans through sun
sun alone
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
