from the black kettle
smoking blue and grey hissing
porridge is cooking
###
the in bend the road
a lazy summer beacon
promising a rest
###
narrow quiet holds soft
rises holds signal closes
glass distant breaks bare
###
infant’s tiny hand
closes around a finger
grip of endless trust
###
when the dust settled
amid the rubble and smoke
past echoes of me
