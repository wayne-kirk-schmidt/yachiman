noon and windows
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
fingerprints lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
bare footsteps
signal folds through footsteps
footsteps breathing
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
