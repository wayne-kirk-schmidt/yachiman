Summer rain begins
Fog drifts across the valley
Light grows soft again
###
Quiet lake reflects
Light shifts over the water
Day slips into rest
###
Soft mist lifts again
Fog drifts across the valley
Warm air comes to rest
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog drifts across the valley
Evening slowing down
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Wind bending tall summer grass
Day slips into rest
