the first motion slow
but builds on every step
weaving successes
###
Waves lean on the shore
Fire sings in orange tongues
Silence full feels now
###
waits God in silence
Water carries old prayers
The water moves
###
lantern drifts water
rain shore slides faint early
settles dim ridge still
###
shore slides wanders
passes path holds quiet signal
closes water slow
