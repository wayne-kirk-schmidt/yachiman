Bright sun warms the stone
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
Time eases its hold
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Wind moves across open fields
Warm air comes to rest
###
Summer rain begins
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Summer rain begins
Wind moves across open fields
Day slips into rest
