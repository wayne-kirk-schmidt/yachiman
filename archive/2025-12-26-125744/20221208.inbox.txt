summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
what have I learned now?
with each day to be stronger
and to lend that strength
###
Grandparents smile gentle
Trees creak like doors in the wind
Clouds pass below us
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog slithers between dark trees
Heat starts to drift off
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
