summit wrapped in cloud
stone shoulders bear the silence
sky leans close to earth
###
glass path valley snow
holds spring distant warm waits shore
valley lantern folds
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist along drifts quiet roads
The heat loosens grip
###
the final breath warms
the air and spreads the blessing
as we move then on
