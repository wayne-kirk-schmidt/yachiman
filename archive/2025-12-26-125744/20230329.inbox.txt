clouds part for the sun
new warmth the floods waiting field
barley bends in thanks
###
pen moves on paper
finds the will to chant in prose
of matters to me
###
austere grey tinting
cold morning bespeckled skies
lightening to blue
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
stone faint signal dim
closes folds empty fades
rises heavy quiet
