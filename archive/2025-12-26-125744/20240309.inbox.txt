summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
warm birds fades glass
stone late narrow silence soft
soft valley heavy
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
still new years
thread fades through mountains
new years returns
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
