one three five seven
continuing on and on
still perfect oddly
###
forests lingers
breath quiet in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
winter drift shadows through trees
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
glass rain snow snow stone
leans circles wave stone passes
breaks silence heavy
