summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
late rivers
echo wanders through rivers
rivers returns
###
rivers lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
new years ridge footprint
breaks signal cold faint fades
stone shadow ridge still
