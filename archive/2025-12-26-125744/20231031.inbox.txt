summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
###
empty sun
salt wanders through sun
sun breathing
###
wanders holds slips wave
quiet soft silence heavy pale
leaf cold wanders folds
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
