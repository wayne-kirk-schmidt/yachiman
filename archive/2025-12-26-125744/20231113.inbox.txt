summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
heavy storms
stone passes through jinja
jinja alone
###
dawn lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
noon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
silence ridge footprint
footprint empty slips faint folds
silence ember path
