Hot pavement steams now
Light shifts over the water
Evening slowing down
###
Warm air moves softly
Wind moves across open fields
Heat starts to drift off
###
Summer rain begins
Light shifts over the water
The long day slows down
###
Warm air moves softly
Heat presses down on the land
Evening slowing down
###
Summer rain begins
Heat presses down on the land
Time eases its hold
