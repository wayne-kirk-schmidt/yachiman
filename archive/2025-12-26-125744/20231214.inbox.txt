Spring equinox dawns
Ice holds the world for a breath
Lungs fill with light now
###
slow distant distant
narrow valley ember stone
faint wave slips fades
###
footsteps and rivers
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
rabbits lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
