cold oceans
wind closes through spiders
oceans unmoving
###
faint sun
shadow wanders through sun
sun at rest
###
what is a purpose?
something compelling or more?
fashion or guidepost?
###
glass ridge settles wave
closes bare fades leaf quiet
doors silence passes
###
Summer rain begins
drifts Fog across the valley
Light grows soft again
