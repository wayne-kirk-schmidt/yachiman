I want to see it
to stare into my own soul
the core within me
###
midnight lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
will I pursue me
finding capability
and celebrate it
###
quiet footprint water
silence breaks drifts silence holds
empty ember leaf
###
thinking in pictures
speaking to allegories
embracing world the
