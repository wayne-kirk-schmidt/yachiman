as we regard blood
within us and among us
binding and flowing
###
cold fades slow soft
drifts lantern soft silence drifts
distant slides ridge
###
Ghosts wait in hallways
Trees creak like doors in the wind
Birds wake the light now
###
slips wave quiet wanders
signal opens soft closes
quiet path narrow holds
###
and the fingers move
all across the scales and chords
mindful of melody
