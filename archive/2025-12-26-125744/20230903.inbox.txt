jinja (shinto temple) lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
night and birds
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
heavy snow signal
silence shore settles late path
still snow path dim path
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
