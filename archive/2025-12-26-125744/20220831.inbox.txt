dim fall
glass slips through fingerprints
fall unmoving
###
still echo footprint
glass lingers wave faint lingers
slow rises early
###
through the cloud cover
white plumes and grey whisps tickle
the nose and the lips
###
at the end of it
the tunnel opens we see
we what labored for
###
late spiders
ember settles through spiders
spiders unmoving
