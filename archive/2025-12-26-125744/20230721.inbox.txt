summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
quiet moon
wind fades through moon
moon alone
###
slips leaf shadow waits
shore empty soft wind slides
water ridge settles
###
distant midnight
wood breaks through midnight
midnight at rest
