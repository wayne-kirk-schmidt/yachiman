summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through mountains
time pauses, listening
###
warm sleep
path lingers through footsteps
sleep breathing
###
pale doors
light fades through spiders
spiders breathing
###
beauty of decay
fragments swirl in that soft wind
teasing the mind's edges
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
