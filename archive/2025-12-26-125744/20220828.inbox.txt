Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along silent roads
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
bare leaf valley bare
narrow pale shadow rises
breaks passes footprint
###
breathes summer softly
rain shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
present it to us
the time the effort the sight
and we will bless it
###
oceans and forests
two cross currents in stillness
time listens, unmoved
