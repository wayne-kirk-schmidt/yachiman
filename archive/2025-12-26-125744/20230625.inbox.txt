God walks winter paths
Prayer moves through frozen air
Silence answers back
###
Winter prayer starts
Stone remembers falling snow
Stillness endures
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Water keeps its way
###
Cold water on stone
Stone remembers falling snow
Silence answers back
###
God waits in silence
Water slips past silent stone
Water keeps its way
