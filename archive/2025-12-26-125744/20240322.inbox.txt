summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
dim spiders
shadow settles through spiders
fireplace at rest
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
Children laugh at dusk
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Plans gently fade now
