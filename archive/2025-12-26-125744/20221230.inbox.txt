mentioning the art
we see in the and walls trains
matched by silences
###
I accept your zen
fully complete without flaw
taught from mastery
###
structuring poems
reaching beyond horizons
gently touching minds
###
glass late cold rises
folds holds early snow settles
still slides echo
###
lunch boxes are simple
and faith keep with the promise
of delicious breaks
