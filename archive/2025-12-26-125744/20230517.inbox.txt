Green fields drink the rain
Fog drifts across the valley
The night comes in slow
###
Green fields drink the rain
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Heat starts to drift off
###
Quiet lake reflects
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm air comes to rest
###
Green fields drink the rain
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
Warm air moves softly
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The night comes in slow
