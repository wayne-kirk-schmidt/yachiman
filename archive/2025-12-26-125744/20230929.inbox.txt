summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
soft signal wind faint
water slips ember quiet still
shore bare late closes
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
Ghosts wait in hallways
Grandparents sip quiet tea
Feet choose their way now
