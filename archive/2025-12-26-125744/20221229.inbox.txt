the birds sadly cry
along seashore the washed clean
by the winter rains
###
reflect in mirrors
splashing across misty lakes
light scatters gently
###
icy mountain peak
reflects that sharp winter moon
stone becomes a lamp
###
faint mountains
wave leans through mountains
new years returns
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through fingerprints
pauses, time listening
