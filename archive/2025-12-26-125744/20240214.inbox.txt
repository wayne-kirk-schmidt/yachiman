summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
oceans and rabbits
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
ember signal quiet
soft narrow snow early leans
slides ridge shore bare
###
cold fades slow soft
drifts lantern soft silence drifts
slides distant ridge
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
