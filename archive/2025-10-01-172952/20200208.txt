Moonlight on the pond,
echo of the distant stars,
mirrors keep their song.

Child stares in the glass,
sees another world beyond,
eyes too wide to blink.

River bends in light,
clouds repeat across the waves,
fish break through the sky.

Cracked mirror in hands,
fragments show a thousand eyes,
none are truly mine.

Winter lake so still,
skaters carve upon the glass,
lines drawn on the sky.

Mirror in the stream,
leaves drifting across the face,
autumn walks away.

Old mirror inside,
frame of oak and silver sheen,
holds forgotten years.

Spring puddle reflects,
children leap across its face,
laughter breaks the sky.

Polished metal gleams,
the blacksmith inspects his work,
firelight bends back.

Water in the well,
faces shimmer deep and pale,
past and present meet.
