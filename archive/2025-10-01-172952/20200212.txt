Campfire fades to ash,
sparks leap up and disappear,
stars absorb their glow.

Ashes in the rain,
washed into the quiet earth,
soil begins to breathe.

Temple incense burns,
ash falls soft upon the stones,
prayers rise and dissolve.

Ashes cloak the land,
mountains once alight with fire,
stand in silence now.

Summer bonfire ends,
children scatter through the dark,
ashes mark the ground.

Smoke curls from the pyre,
ashes drift to greet the dawn,
sunrise takes them home.

Ashes in the bowl,
mark the hours of the night watch,
monks whisper their chants.

Ashes scatter far,
over rivers, hills, and seas,
rest in every place.

From the ash of fire,
phoenix rises bright with song,
life begins again.

Ashes left behind,
traces of what once had been,
memories still burn.
