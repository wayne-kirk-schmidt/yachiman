The pondâ€™s quiet face,
reflecting a startled bird,
ripples scatter sky.

Mirror on the wall,
shows a stranger in my eyes,
time has walked away.

Shards of broken glass,
catch the moon in crooked lines,
stars are cut to threads.

Lake reflects the trees,
upside down and swaying slow,
summer drifts away.

Old mirror in hall,
polished frame collects the dust,
eyes of past return.

Silver water still,
clouds lie upon gentle waves,
night bends to the shore.

Shattered mirror falls,
scattering the silent room,
shadows split in two.

Morning dew reflects,
sunlight glitters on each drop,
grass becomes a sky.

Window glass at night,
my face floats with ghostly clouds,
rain streaks hide the stars.

Mirror by the door,
shoes lined up in quiet rows,
house remembers all.
