Children lift their lights,
lanterns swinging in the dusk,
voices fill the streets.

Old lantern on hook,
rust creeps up the iron frame,
glass still holds the flame.

Lantern at the inn,
beckons travelers to rest,
fire waits within walls.

Lantern by the grave,
soft light warms the frozen stone,
prayers drift to the sky.

Lantern on the bridge,
moon above in pale reply,
water flows beneath.

Lantern by the stream,
moths dance with the gentle flame,
night hums with their song.

Festival of lights,
lanterns rising with the stars,
wishes ride the wind.

Lantern shines at dawn,
its small flame outshone by sun,
smoke curls to the blue.

Lantern guards the path,
foxes pause to watch the glow,
night deepens around.

Old man lights his lamp,
lantern glows against the years,
shadows bow to time.
