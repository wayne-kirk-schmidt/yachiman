Old station at dusk,
whistle fades into the hills,
lamps glow on the tracks.

Empty wooden bench,
trains pass without a rider,
leaves dance on the floor.

Ticket booth is closed,
dust lies heavy on the glass,
trains still whisper by.

Waiting for the dawn,
passengers clutch bags and dreams,
smoke curls from the stack.

Autumn rain drizzles,
umb hands hold a paper cup,
station clock ticks slow.

Summer rush of sound,
steam bursts from the iron beast,
voices crowd the hall.

Lanterns mark the gate,
soldiers board with heavy packs,
shadows linger long.

Children wave goodbye,
faces pressed against the glass,
train wheels start to sing.

Winter snow drifts high,
platform buried under white,
silence halts the day.

Station cat asleep,
ignores whistles and the bells,
world moves without him.
