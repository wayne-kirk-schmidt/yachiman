Ashes on the breeze,
remnants of a summer fire,
settle into dusk.

Fireplace grows dim,
embers curl in dying light,
smoke threads into night.

Forest fire long gone,
ashes coat the blackened earth,
life waits to return.

Ashes on the shore,
waves sweep them into the sea,
memories dissolve.

From the hearth they rise,
spirals of forgotten flame,
fade into the sky.

Charcoal whispers low,
ashes scatter with the wind,
night swallows the spark.

Ashes mark the path,
where the bonfire once had roared,
now the silence stays.

Hands sift through the ash,
find a glimmer of old gold,
smile beneath the soot.

Burnt paper drifts high,
letters lost to summer fire,
words become the sky.

Ashes on the field,
seeds push through the silent grey,
springtime claims the ground.
