Empty luggage cart,
rust upon the iron frame,
no one claims the past.

Voices echo loud,
footsteps scatter through the hall,
trains sigh in the night.

Old man sells his wares,
apples bright in paper bags,
bells call travelers.

Rain against the roof,
station waits in weary peace,
day departs again.

Signs point to journeys,
to the sea or to the hills,
all roads start from here.

Soldiers part in tears,
letters folded in their hands,
smoke blinds their faces.

Morning crowd arrives,
coffee warms the restless hands,
trains move into day.

Empty station lights,
flicker on the broken wall,
trains lost to the past.

Springtime trains return,
cherry blossoms greet the doors,
petals ride the wind.

Clock above the gate,
hands stand still for just a breath,
train departs on time.
