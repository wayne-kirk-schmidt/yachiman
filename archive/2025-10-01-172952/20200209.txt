A lantern sways low,
painting circles in the dark,
moths drift to its flame.

Lantern by the gate,
shadows stretch across the yard,
night leans on the wall.

Paper lantern glows,
riverside reflects the light,
children chase the dusk.

Autumn lantern bright,
hangs upon the wooden post,
rain falls soft and slow.

Lantern on the deck,
sailors gather round its glow,
sea hums in the night.

Winter path ahead,
lantern guides the traveler,
snowfall hides the road.

Festival begins,
paper lanterns float away,
stars return the glow.

Lantern in the barn,
shadows dance upon the beams,
cows shift in the straw.

Lantern on the hill,
shines across the sleeping town,
home lies far below.

Lantern in the wind,
its flame bends but does not break,
hope resists the storm.
