wrinkles show us time
gently etching gracefully
wisdom flourishes

fingers curl and flex
bright with wonder eyes roaming
discovering life

austere and wise stand
peaks mingling with playful clouds
gently touching sky

unspoken language
expressing a connection
the blooms of deep love

a blank slate awaits
what will the first words be then?
gazing at the crib
