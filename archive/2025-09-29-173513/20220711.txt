I can spend the time
watching dark kettles bubbling
in the grey morning

logs and twigs floating
within the river rushing
towards the blue lakes

what example is set?
when we sit down or stand up
to our family?

motion of the mind
racing across new landscapes
imagination

one plus three plus five
series of numbers that waltz
within our notebooks
