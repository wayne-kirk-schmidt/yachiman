restart and finish
each day progressing further
new accomplishments

if we can find love
within distractions of life
cling to that fiercely

fishes approach slow
circling quite lazily
curious with us

the depth of the ash
cooling the skin erasing
the heat of the wound

closing the boxes
you can see the writing now
worn grey on yellow
