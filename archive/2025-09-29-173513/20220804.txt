rails stretching bending
snaking through dark mountaintops
small towns slipping past

candle light gutters
near evening tide
breeze carries

I walk with old ghosts
across floors and through hallways
to meet our new ghosts

stepping from heaven
touching sand on the seashore
gently wading still

in a dim sunset
tuck the family asleep
humming lullabies
