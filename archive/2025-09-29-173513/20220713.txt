morning or at dusk
put pen to a new paper
capturing ideas

hop! and then scurry.
small and furry looking up
with eight hopeful eyes

inchworms also snails
are great professors teaching
determination

sharks circling at sea
knowing who and what they are
elegant hunters

the first strokes are dry
suggest to the heart the rest
of our dear story
