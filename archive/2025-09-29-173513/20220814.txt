morning habits help
shape grey light and sleepy sight
helping our routine

do we count dishes?
washed or measure sheets folded
as the years move on?

boiled water enters
cold white cups, with tea waiting
steeping brown rivers

windows separate
almost clear yet showing ghosts
of us watching us

after reading books
pondering their messages
see ourselves better
