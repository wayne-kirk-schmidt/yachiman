waves crash silently
seagulls weaving within troughs
glide on salty breeze

Deep dark blue whispers
quietly waiting shadows
secrets never said

with mirror flash bright
single light, streaks from the earth
thunder dully roars

gathering clouds fall
speeding to the earth grimly
storms gather to dance

cleansing showers fall
washing away our worries
nature's gift of tears
