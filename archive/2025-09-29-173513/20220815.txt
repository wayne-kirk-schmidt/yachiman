sweeping fallen dust
organizing and cleaning
knowing it returns

with vivid colors
explosions of bright beauty
fireworks in brushstrokes

the monk sits and sees
white rabbits hopping playing
new year has arrived

ground pepper and salt
balances tastes guide the meal
as the soup simmers

between the red gates
silently watching people
fulfilling a vow
