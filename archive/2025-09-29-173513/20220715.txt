puddles swell darkly
rain pouring down noisily
rushing to the sea

breezes slithering
dripping moisture and seeping
in the late summer

flowers are dancing
within green ballrooms under
gentle warm daytimes

measuring heartbeats
precious and unique, sacred
empowering you

cry only for now
face fears and nurture resolve
emerging stronger
