with music fading
we listen to the last sounds
composing further

narrowing further
first broad then finer then finest
we shave off error

long and wide circling
crossing both seas and mountains
locating us all

sitting with a book
intimate and favorite
stories that touch us

dust and pebbles swept
by the skillful broom and pan
growing brown and white
