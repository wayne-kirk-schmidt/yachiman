stretching your hand out
touching hoary icicles
in the deep forest

motionless water
remembering from prison
the joy of summer

slowing down to stop
rare blooms beckoning shyly
nectar smells so sweet

soup simmers chirping
with happiness and promise
"hot tasty dinner!"

pulling overcoats
defending against winter
grey and grey mixing
