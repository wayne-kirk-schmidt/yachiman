hands reaching upwards
grasping for understanding
lying on the street

my companion
sitting and squawking and looks
sitting on tree branch

walking in the park
past panthers past museums
gearing for jogging

and looking westward
the people sigh in the dusk
as the green deepens

sliding into home
saving the one game instead
of teaching the game
