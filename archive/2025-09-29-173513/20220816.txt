so strange to view it
simple drops snaking downward
on cool morning walls

gentle river flow
carving through the ancient stones
caressing jungles

glistening droplets
nature's liquid symphony
river's memory

dancing flames leaping
sparks laughing in the night sky
glowing fading cold

fiery sunset
horizon ignites briefly
then darkens to night
