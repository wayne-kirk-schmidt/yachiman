chapters are written
after love sometimes before
on books in our hearts

simple words to use
I'm sorry. please forgive me.
and I forgive you.

walls were created
to halt ghosts from coming in
instead keeping them

it is relieving
that we move beyond our past
into the future

now that I can see
behind, before, and alongside
I also see me
