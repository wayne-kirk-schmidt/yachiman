minutes walk slowly
while spry seconds dance and sing
and years stately crawl

medallions glint
devotion and piety
in the morning light

appetites will change
governed by situation
reflecting our self

great aunt in dawn light
elegantly, sparingly
preparing breakfast

tools learn about us
from use from respite from care
as we do the same
