push the can over
watch it sink into the deep
leaking out grey green

in our life story
there are soft days and weekends
within the chapters

something that beetles
can teach us every day
work diligently

connections form fast
and develop also thrive
within the springtime

walking on water
to his friend reaching for help
astonishing all
