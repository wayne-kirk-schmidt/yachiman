mist obscures our view
teasing chilling the senses
hills and valleys veiled

shroud of gray mourning
elegant whispers of grief
hiding within dawn

slipping through our hands
sands moves and flows as it must
dreams hiding within

marching with purpose
each tick that tock each second
weaving our life tapestry

gentle touch of time
passage etched in flesh and stone
our stories unfold
