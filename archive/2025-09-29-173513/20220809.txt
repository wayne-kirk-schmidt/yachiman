books and libraries
beckon young readers to dream
by turning pages

within the snowfall
hidden inside each snowflake
frozen ice cities

who will be the last?
speak love with a final poem
that follows the first

I am grateful now
calm where I could not have been
during our time then

reflecting on loss
is it a breaking of me?
or is it mending?
