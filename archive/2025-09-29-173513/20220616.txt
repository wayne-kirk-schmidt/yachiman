silence reflects blue
in the night and in morning
radiates yellow

faces fresh from sleeping
look at the wondrous daybreak
dreams having faded

purpose of tables
true resolve and fine courage
and to bear witness

orange robes flutter
wind gently and lightly blows
on the leaf-strewn path

simple meals feed us
simple teachings inspire us
simple drinks fill us
