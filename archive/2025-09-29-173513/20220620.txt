wolves move silently
padding in the blue forest
orange eyes gleaming

morning breaking fast
looking at ingredients
possibilities

decisions flow well
upon the bridge of reason
holding hands with faith

billions born and gone
silent galleries judging
each day for us all

now the time is right
says the shark as she swam fast
to see her children
