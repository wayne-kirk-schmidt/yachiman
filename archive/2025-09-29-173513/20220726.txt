first, there are oceans
then there is nothing but dust
then oceans return

I sought freedom first
and after finding my goals
both they and I changed

shells in my hands crack
with old age in the water
feeding sands anew

after rain we smell
solitary shores drying
celebrating calm

music should pull you
further into your future
celebrating you
