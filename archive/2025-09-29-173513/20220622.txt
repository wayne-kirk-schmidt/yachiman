lemon yellow drops
secretly sour and tart-sweet
swirled within the cheek

craft the tapestry
combining fine and broad threads
for every day

fine feathers flapping
lifting upwards to heaven
first in the morning

descend into pools
of green and brown also blue
and everything

maps and charts stating
compasses also guiding
providing a path
