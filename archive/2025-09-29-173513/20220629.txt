capturing the group
and replacing the contents
finish procedure

reflecting daylight
within the grains of white sand
waiting for water

old friends are waiting
by fireplaces by coffee shops
waiting for your smile

moving into cold
white then blue then silver shine
our chilled breath lingers

liquid heat sits down
daring you to move a bit
leaving sweat rivers
