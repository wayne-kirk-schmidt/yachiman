reflecting on faith
offering us harmony
if we pursue it

wheels hiding secrets?
not really. just perspectives.
continuity

thistles in the lawn
freely striving and growing
different and proud

roads we move at night
secret, special, beautiful
roads we walk at dawn

diaries explain
about us every day
what we tell others
