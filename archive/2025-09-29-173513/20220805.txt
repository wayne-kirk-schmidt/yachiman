navigating me
Look at rivers, lakes, and seas
see small distant shores

streaking memory
settling gently flurrying
snow falls in the past

simple pleasures hold
us in delight and wonder
meals, water, and sleep

small ascetic ways
contrasting with busy life
taken best in turns

shields become thick walls
since protection easily
can instead stifle
