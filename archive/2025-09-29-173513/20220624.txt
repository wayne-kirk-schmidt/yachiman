insistent quiet
till bass line and drums kick in
music building now

spider walks weaving
building order and beauty
before the morning

nothing is written
on pages, nothing on white
telling us nothing

flags gently wiping
breezes in summer sunshine
rare peaceful moments

horrors and nightmares
circling deep within the heart
only if we want
