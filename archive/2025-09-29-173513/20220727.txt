regarding the moon
sailing through both wax and wane
framed by sweet incense

what did we do then?
as the rain stops suddenly
within nighttime tide

I will push the voice
within my heart and my soul
to sing of new joy

On the final note
air lingering capturing
past in the present

we rush to the sea
fighting against swelling tides
gray remembrances
