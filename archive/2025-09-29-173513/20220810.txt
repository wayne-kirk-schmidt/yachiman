brushes desperate
to say, to shout, and to sing
wait within the well

poems are skipping
walking along mental shores
empowering souls

altars and bushes
smoldering with messages
the yearn to be read

within the darkness
shadows slithering slowly
caresses the night

first wishes and dreams
then we turn towards doing
in pursuit of dreams
