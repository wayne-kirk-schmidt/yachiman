meeting companions
exploring obligations
interweaving lives

what came first for us?
was it purpose? form? meaning?
something different?

prayer is focus
within, outside, and around
balancing ourselves

single candle drips
red, smoking slightly while smoke
leisurely wafting

retrace decisions
through darkness seeking answers
until dawning light
