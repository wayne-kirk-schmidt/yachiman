behind a grey wall
flittering and fluttering
bright green butterflies

house after house sit
on streets darkened by our fear
waiting for love's light

running along shores
see the sky. smelling the sea.
drapes our soul with peace

thin causeway breathing
thinner then wider at tides
slow liquid heartbeats

the horse stops to drink
delicious water gulped fast
after the last race
