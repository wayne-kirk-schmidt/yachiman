single low rumbling
a growl waiting for the roar
within the dark clouds

backbones record time
in aches and pains and posture
familiarly

dinner uneaten
on the table in stark light
waiting for return

at last the nighttime
lay my head down and reflect
on previous days

the razor gliding
plows ahead uncovering
revealing ourselves
