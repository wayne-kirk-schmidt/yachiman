connecting again
bells of curiosity
chiming of joy

simple wrappers sit
hinting at rice and, of fish
a meal well enjoyed

constructing our home
starts with both our hearts meeting
and builds out from there

agape and shut tight
rigid grey guarding access
keeping ancient oaths

with practice we grasp
edges of craft reflecting
some maturity
