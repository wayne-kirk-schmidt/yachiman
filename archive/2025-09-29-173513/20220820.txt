what midnight stars shine?
constellations ask questions
also tell stories

shining pale and bright
full of rabbits and old men
mysteries abound

your shadows whisper
to mine and tell of times gone
when we could still speak

dog bridles and barks
gray and misty on the hill
we are not welcome

parting and grieving
growing through loss; moving on
scars are welcome clothes
