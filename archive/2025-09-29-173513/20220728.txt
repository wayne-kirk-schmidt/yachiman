refreshing my soul
stepping within and outside
celebrating growth

and we move on then
from our youth to age to age
enjoying each step

I can imagine
special worlds glittering bright
yet within ourselves

move from day to night
wondering at the changes
enjoy sunrises

focus is fleeting
shy and trusting also rare
also full of joy
