brown and white birds fly
deftly scaling clouds and winds
on summer sunsets

early blossoms wink
teasing secrets of new growth
promising blossoms

no one can see it
dark secret quiet spaces
before we wake up

Abbot, what is dharma?
while sweeping slowly smiling
he said "all, yet none"

necessary food
for the mind, for soul, for self
read, write, and reflect
