swinging memory
front to back past to future
travels in circles

ducklings assembling
within the cold pond swimming
at beautiful dawn

presenting myself
gaze from mirror to mirror
within the hallway

writing my journal
black dancing on white stages
the ballet of days

weather looming dark
first fat droplets promising
the shower to come
