carry your burden
place it gently on the shore
say goodbye with love

the book on the self
beats with possibilities
the heart that looks on

nothing is destroyed
but is changed also transformed
match the chosen path

not that we see it
but the soul stretches and sighs
after each new joy

hanging on each word
the mind looks to build music
from conversation
