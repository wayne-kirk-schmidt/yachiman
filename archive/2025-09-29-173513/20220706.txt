sleep evades us still
chasing the sun and the moon
something we reach for

rounding the sun we run
chasing ourselves cheerfully
marking time passing

kind words can strengthen
support and demonstrate love
the work we should do

I sit on the shore
throwing rocks and watching waves
blending with the sand

beaches blazing white
hide colonies and rare worlds
within the surface
