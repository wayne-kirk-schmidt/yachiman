blankets of pure white
serene and austere covers
adorning the land

delicate crystals
dancing and falling in groups
celebrating winter

guarding from above
weaving bright from wax to wane
bathing the night time

crescents are smiling
whispering secrets to us
while we are asleep

golden liquid beams
drowning dark and warming hearts
as the warmth lingers
