mercy falling earthbound
from the deep lakes of heaven
watering our souls

considering love
special and precious healing
flowering red blooms

simple notes held high
lingering, pleading with us
descending to earth

what is discipline?
a promise. a commitment.
to be there each day.

back and forth in dreams
navigating almost there
teaches very much
