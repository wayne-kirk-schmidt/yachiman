simple meals delight
balanced and noble landscapes
created with love

gaze at once torn cloth
mended with care and purpose
serene and patient

jumbles of brown twigs
bundles carrying purpose
ready to be used

green mold flourishes
in cracks within red mountains
basking in grey shade

waves push to and fro
at seashore day, noon, and night
water always dancing
