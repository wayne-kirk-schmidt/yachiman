And we spend time here
within white and grey gardens
tending memories

small patches of grass
pulling at selective weeds
what is left behind?

wisdom though quite small
elegant and practical
to guide our questions

when we ask for light
the reply will consider
our current darkness

determination
simple straight and purposeful
moving to the goal
