we move through puddles
flowing around our footsteps
laughing all the time

shaving off wood burrs
shaping the beam for good use
as we change also

mist plumes and expands
breath of air and hope mixing
within cold morning

we can manage us
first looking into mirrors
to see who we are

calling between hours
minutes play and run laughing
marking the time spent
