rushing to the wall
see instead of barriers
opportunities

within our hearts find
the jewels of kindness and joy
waiting to be shared

not that I can share
but I can show you the way
where you walk yourself

each path can be blessed
by faith or grace or wisdom
each to each their path

finally we sit
waiting for sunset and talk
about today's walk
