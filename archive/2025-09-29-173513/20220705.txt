and then we stood tall
on rising white-hot sand dunes
waiting for the rain

one twig bends supple
green and yielding in the rain
making a new way

old shells and husks shield
but stay the same while we grow
and must be replaced

chimneys leak white smoke
islands in the gentle night
whispering of food

unleavened bread steaming
fresh from the kitchen brown white
celebrating freedom
