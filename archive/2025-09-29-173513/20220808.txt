gently singing she
holds sleepy children in arms
completing the day

cups are broken
yet not discarded; remade
fissures show beauty

something beautiful
showing age and wear and pride
elegantly used

the abbot walks slow
looking at pebbles below
with each careful step

what does sweeping mean?
cleaning and organizing?
or celebrating?
