what will walk with us?
compassion or resentment
each step we will choose

to understand goals
we start with our dreams and build
looking beyond now

clarifying goals
discovering our purpose
running on that road

sleepy but alert
the spider sits on the web
waiting for callers

light dusting falls
glinting in bright white sunlight
covering the floor
