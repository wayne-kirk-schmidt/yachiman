red pebbles or brown
stacked up and thrown down again
in dry river beds

clarity forms within
reflecting on our actions
we can see clearly

fish swimming slowly
quiet worlds lie within worlds
gold and red and green

tea steeping slowly
steaming and cooling to drink
eventually

the first bite today
linking delicious tastes to
the last bite tonight
