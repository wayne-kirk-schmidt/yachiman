what we could see now
is the bright today lining
built on the warm past

to see leprechauns
look for possibilities
within the shamrocks

spoken so slowly
exposition retelling
original tales

figures in mirrors
gaze out at echoes long gone
and yet soon to be

monitoring the sun
arcing from grey to white to red
and then back again
