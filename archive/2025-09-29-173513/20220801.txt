within the second
footprint melting the first snow
following the first

grey chill sits silent
watching steaming breath hurry
to the train station

I will sip my tea
and dreaming of rare wonders
start my day building

we were silent then
though now we are full of song
yet will be silent

small crumbs sit on white
remembering meals we ate
echoes of fine feasts
