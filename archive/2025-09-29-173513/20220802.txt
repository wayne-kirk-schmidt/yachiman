through the green thickets
rain drizzling on my shoulders
relishing the warmth

staring into ponds
ripples dance cresting just now
from the stone I threw

dragonfly bold green
zips in and lands for heartbeats
when rested then leaves

books are reflections
who we are and what we said
precious to review

the pen falters now
yet just for a brief second
as we tell the tale
