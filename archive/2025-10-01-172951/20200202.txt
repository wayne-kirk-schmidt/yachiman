Last leaves race the storm,
whirling through the empty street,
lamps flicker in haste.

Flags whip in the gust,
clouds dash across fading light,
evening hurries in.

Busy market square,
traders shout their wares aloud,
coins exchange like rain.

Snowflakes fall too fast,
trees cannot hold all the weight,
branches bow in haste.

Fox dashes through fields,
a shadow across the dusk,
prey flees swift and blind.

Notes scrawled in a rush,
ink blurs beneath hurried hands,
meaning half concealed.

Summer bees dart fast,
moving flower into flower,
honey built with speed.

Roosters call at once,
dawn hurries across the hills,
farmers stir awake.

River bends too sharp,
waters hurry past the reeds,
fish scatter away.

Winter night so long,
stars hurry behind the clouds,
moonlight fades too soon.
