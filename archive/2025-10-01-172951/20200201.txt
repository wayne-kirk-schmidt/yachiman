Morning bells ringing,
people rushing down the street,
footsteps blur like rain.

Autumn leaves scatter,
the wind hurries them away,
none return again.

Children late for class,
books clutched tightly as they run,
laughter trails behind.

Shadows chase the sun,
the hurried clouds drift apart,
sky clears for the dawn.

Hands wave from the gate,
a train pulls away too fast,
tears are left behind.

Summer storms arrive,
rivers hurry to the sea,
rocks stand still in flow.

Letters fall from hands,
wind carries the words away,
secrets left untold.

Thunder in the hills,
rain hurries across the fields,
cattle rush for home.

Springtime rivers rise,
melting ice flows swift and hard,
the bridge trembles low.

Runners in the park,
shoes striking in quick rhythm,
hearts beat against time.
