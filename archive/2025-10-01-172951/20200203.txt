Frost etches windows,
shadows creep across the glass,
night holds back the dawn.

Breath turns into mist,
cold air sharp against the skin,
lanterns glow like stars.

Winter winds arrive,
rattling through the wooden eaves,
silence fills the room.

Snow gathers on pines,
chill needles weigh down the boughs,
birds hide from the frost.

Icy stream runs slow,
chill water hardens the stones,
fish wait in the deep.

Cold upon the fields,
crows lift off in sudden waves,
winter sun is weak.

Frozen garden path,
steps crunch heavy in the frost,
roses sleep in ice.

Windowpanes shimmer,
tiny patterns bloom in glass,
art of winter's hand.

Hands in woolen gloves,
children chase the frozen breath,
laughter chills the air.

Quiet evening falls,
chill moon rises over snow,
crickets silent now.
