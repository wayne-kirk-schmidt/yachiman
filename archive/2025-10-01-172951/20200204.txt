Dark horizon bends,
cold winds scatter drifting ash,
north star flickers faint.

Sheep crowd in the barn,
their breath clouds the frozen air,
lantern warms the straw.

Frozen puddles crack,
boots shatter the brittle ice,
splinters catch the light.

Winter crow calls twice,
the sound lingers in the cold,
tree branches shiver.

Snow against the roof,
hard frost binds the tiles with ice,
morning waits to come.

Winter river still,
fox steps lightly on the ice,
leaves no mark behind.

Chill winds press the doors,
fire struggles in the hearth,
shadows lean and fade.

Stars glitter sharper,
chill air clears the midnight sky,
moon sails bright and cold.

Leaves crunch underfoot,
the last autumn chill remains,
winter takes its place.

Frost steals all color,
only white and grey remain,
night holds earth in hand.
