beach shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening

falling from heaven
white blue and and grey and green
spring weather colors

divisions in clay
shaped and smoothed guided with love
to build the vessel
###
polish the mirror
set into the sky giving
the moon and the stars
###
no, we have the past
as a book, but not a shrine.
to help prepare us
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fireplace shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listens
###
dust lies in the hall
comfortable serene and
the remnants of skin
###
Warm moves air softly
Wind moves across open fields
Light grows soft again

the needs of the many masses
he gave loaves and fish

to reflect on our past deeds
and hold our heads high?

soft otera
silence breaks through otera
otera at rest
###
looking in journals
written lovingly in ink
telling old stories
###
Warm air moves softly
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
###
dust moving around
pockets swirling quickly up
to meet the new day
###
weaving tonal webs
the best of them talk to us
with the strings they make
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening

slips soft lingers pale
bare closes heavy echo
opens path snow sun

living life full of purpose
to defiant the world

summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
otera (buddhist temple) and footsteps
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved

simple wrappers sit
hinting at rice and, of fish
a meal well enjoyed
###
new years lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
working with numbers
changes are so beautiful
showing new patterns
###
pure water settles
into the spreading being,
healing, strengthening
###
I want the future
married with and present past
in a single day
###
the horizon sits
in judgement on the present
witness to the past
###
nothing can cross this
as that line is drawn in dust
yet it is erased
###
no sure thing walks small
instead swims deep and runs far
as all sure things do
###
dancing and weaving
child and adult both twirling
alone in the room
###
prayer is focus
within, outside, and around
balancing ourselves
###
stage each of my life
is built on the prior work
each within others
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Fog drifts across the valley
Shadows stretch at dusk

storms shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
change comes to us all
small at first later bigger
always becoming

summer breathes softly
rivers shadows through drift jinja
time pauses, listening

sbrightly evil mostly pure
really a balance
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening

formula demands
precision and attention
producing results
###
to see leprechauns
look for possibilities
within the shamrocks

Midday meal, bowls set
Heaven opens within small joys
Hands grip the rail now
###
narrow glass bare drifts
path slips dim holds water slow
waits empty ridge slow

distant trees
silence passes through trees
fingerprints at rest
###
forests and footsteps
two currents cross within stillness
time listens, unmoved

walking through that sand
dreaming of green seas and waves
that flowed long ago
###
and yet we are here
pushing on with all our strength
against moving seas
###
the writing scriptures
recollection from before
discussing great things
###
Cracked mirror in hands,
fragments show a thousand eyes,
none are truly mine.

late rivers
echo wanders through rivers
rivers returns
###
offered in service
bread and wine to the faithful
which nurtures their faith

summer softly breathes
doors shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening

where seagulls float serenely
over ink-black seashores

sleep turns the page

three blue one grey
stones piled; silent pyramids
marking the pathway

midnight lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page

finding capability

empty ember leaf
###
thinking in pictures
speaking to allegories
embracing world the
