summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
early deer
snow lingers through windows
windows alone
###
midnight lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
