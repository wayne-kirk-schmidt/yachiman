stars lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
narrow otera
wind rises through sun
sun returns
###
glass path valley snow
holds spring distant warm waits shore
valley lantern folds
###
Noon rests over fields
Moon hangs above sleeping roofs
Day begins slow now
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
