and when we are five
see more than when we are two
while dreaming of more
###
come from that heavens
carrying spears to the bridge
waters swirl to life
###
bare summer
valley wanders through summer
summer alone
###
early deer
snow lingers through windows
alone windows
###
nothing in the hall
catches the weight of silence
or sees the shadows
