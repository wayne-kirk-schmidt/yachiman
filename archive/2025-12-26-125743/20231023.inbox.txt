summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
cold birth
shore waits through mountains
birth at rest
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
birthday lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
