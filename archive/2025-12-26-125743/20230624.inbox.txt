Cold prayer in winter
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Faith stays unbroken
###
Frozen river bends
Water carries old prayers
Winter does not speak
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Cold hands touch running water
The water moves
###
Winter water flows
Prayer moves through frozen air
Water keeps its way
###
Winter water flows
God listens without reply
Winter does not speak
