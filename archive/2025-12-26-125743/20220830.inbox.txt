try your hand at this
monk said to the acolyte
and see what happens
###
hearts want what they want
and plead for passions to rise
stoked by caresses
###
smells remain in air
of reminding what has been
afterimages
###
summer softly breathes
rivers shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
Summer rain begins
Rain moves across still water
Light grows soft again
