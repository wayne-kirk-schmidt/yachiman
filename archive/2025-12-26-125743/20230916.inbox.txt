summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
bare midnight
path rises through spiders
midnight returns
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
stone faint signal dim
closes folds empty fades
rises heavy quiet
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
