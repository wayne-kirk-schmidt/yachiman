summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
Angels pass unseen
Flame writes bright notes on the air
Day closes tight now
###
glass soft narrow doors
leaf valley footprint valley
footprint shadow path
###
soft summer
paper drifts through fog
doors at rest
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
