summer softly breathes
fall shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
flies born in summer
glide within autumn breezes
yet still in winter
###
the ancient trees sway
with knowledge of the wood green
wild and powerful
###
wanders valley pale
echo soft wave cold water
silence fades cold
###
lantern slow silence
closes ember opens waits
drifts lingers opens
