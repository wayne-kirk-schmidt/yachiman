summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
noon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
still dawn
shore leans through dawn
dawn at rest
###
passes early leaf
silence distant glass cold holds
waits distant opens
###
Waves lean on the shore
Moon hangs above sleeping roofs
Birds wake the light now
