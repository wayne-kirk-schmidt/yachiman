first kiss caresses
the cheek seeking now the heart
smiling as warmth spreads
###
Soft mist lifts again
Heat presses down on the land
The night comes within slow
###
breaks opens lingers
slow footprint settles footprint
glass stone pale closes
###
of the thirteen
whose souls spans across ages
simple true mirrors
###
mercer the spider
walks along a simple path
glistening silken strand
