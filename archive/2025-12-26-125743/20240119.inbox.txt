heavy otera
water passes through otera
otera breathing
###
jinja (shinto temple) lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
Snow veils the bare road
Thread binds torn cloth back to whole
Sleep stays nearby now
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
