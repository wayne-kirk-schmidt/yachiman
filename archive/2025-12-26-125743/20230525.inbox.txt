Thin fog drifts at dawn
Fog slithers between dark trees
Warm air comes to rest
###
Green fields drink the rain
Fog drifts across the valley
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Hot pavement steams now
Light shifts over the water
Heat starts to drift off
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm air comes to rest
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Fog slithers between dark trees
Day slips into rest
