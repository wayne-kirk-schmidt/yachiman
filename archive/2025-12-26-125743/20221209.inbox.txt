mention it say now
the things that come from that heart
spoken earnestly
###
distant sun
clock leans through sun
alone sun
###
Hot pavement steams now
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The long day slows down
###
nothing on that edge
just ice, steam, water droplets
remnants of passage
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
