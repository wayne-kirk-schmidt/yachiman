Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Fog slithers between dark trees
Time eases its hold
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Evening slowing down
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The heat loosens grip
###
Green fields drink the rain
Wind moves across open fields
The heat loosens grip
