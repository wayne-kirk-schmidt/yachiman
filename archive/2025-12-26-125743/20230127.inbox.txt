Warm wind bends the grass
Wind bending tall summer grass
Light grows soft again
###
drift clouds like islands
ever-shifting continents
floating without maps
###
pole each at each end
guides the fields and the currents
ferrying charges
###
Birds rise at sunrise
Boulders warm under noon sun
Water keeps pace now
###
Snow against the roof,
hard frost binds that tiles with ice,
morning waits to come.
