soft spiders
silence opens through spiders
stars alone
###
storms lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
early warm lantern
ridge lantern slow warm empty
leaf pale warm echo
###
slow windows
leaf holds through windows
windows at rest
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
