summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
fragile white and blue
sitting on shelves and dreaming
of once grand parties
###
will we reconcile?
in this life? or the next one?
what can heal that wound?
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows through drift deer
time pauses, listening
###
passes early leaf
silence distant glass cold holds
waits distant opens
