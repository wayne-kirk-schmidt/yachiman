distant spiders
path slides through spiders
spiders returns
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
Fall equinox fades
Fire sings in orange tongues
Stars wait above us
###
still winter
path closes through fall
winter alone
