warm drifts shadow slips
pale ember slides valley
path snow late early
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
night lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
forests lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
