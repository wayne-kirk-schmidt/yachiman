waits cold holds lingers
cold stone shadow late signal
shadow breaks snow quiet
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
wind cold late shore drifts
opens lingers windows snow
signal faint drifts wind
###
early dawn
shadow opens through dawn
sleep returns
