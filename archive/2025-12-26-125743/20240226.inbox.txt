summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
Forest breathes in mist
Tengu glide on mountain air
Day waits its turn now
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
beach and rain
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
empty waits leans beach
distant faint shadow holds drifts
closes bare soft leaf
