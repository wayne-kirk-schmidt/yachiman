signal slow silence
leans snow leans water lantern
footprint heavy path
###
Evening meal is shared
Trees creak like doors in the wind
Plans gently fade now
###
winter and stars
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
valley soft soft faint
heavy stone ridge breaks shore slow
pale still distant moon
###
doors lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
