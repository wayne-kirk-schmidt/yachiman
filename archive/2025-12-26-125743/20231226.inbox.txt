trees and storms
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
dim storms
ridge slips through storms
storms returns
###
mist and sun
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
waits bare slips path shore
trees faint slides cold slow wave
path wanders valley
###
heavy beach
thread lingers through beach
beach at rest
