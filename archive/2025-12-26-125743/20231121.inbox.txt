closes signal shore
quiet early signal ember
glass distant shore ridge
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
bare early ember
breaks slides leaf ember path
silence leaf new years
###
warm storms
snow lingers through storms
storms alone
###
shore waits warm passes
closes warm heavy opens
cold passes snow holds
