early silence drifts
ridge quiet lingers leaf footprint
cold heavy early
###
push for loving grace
apply it, seek, it, grant it
to wrap our actions
###
even a blood-red moon
hints promises of the sun
moving in the sky
###
Winter water flows
Gray clouds press on still rivers
endures Stillness
###
with vegetables
and simple spices we make
a welcoming meal
