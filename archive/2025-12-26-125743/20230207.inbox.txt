regarding valleys
we see the mountains pathway
also proud return
###
leaf wave slow drifts path
echo rises heavy still
cold empty slides
###
fast Running or far
Our world seen blurred or clearly
Yet always forward
###
beach and rain
two currents cross within stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
Hot steams pavement now
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Evening slowing down
