distant trees
silence passes through trees
fingerprints at rest
###
Firelight on paper
Parents share a last small laugh
Mind clears at once now
###
spring lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
drifts glass still ember
silence signal soft slips glass
glass lantern silence
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
