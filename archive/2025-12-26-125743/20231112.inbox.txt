summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
water shore ember
warm footprint opens pale slips
ridge wave glass opens
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
Noon rests over fields
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Day forms itself now
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
