glass rain snow snow stone
leans circles wave stone passes
breaks silence heavy
###
quiet noon
path fades through noon
noon returns
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
victory tiptoes
inside ourselves and takes root
when we first believe
###
I sit next to ghosts
and while we talk they and I
we see futures pass
