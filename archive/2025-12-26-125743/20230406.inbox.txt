polish the mirror
set into the sky giving
the moon and the stars
###

as a book, but not a shrine.

rivers shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fireplace shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listens
