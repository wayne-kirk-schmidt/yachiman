Prayer rises in cold
Water slips past silent stone
The water moves
###
Winter water flows
God listens without reply
The water moves
###
Prayer rises in cold
Stone remembers falling snow
Winter does not speak
###
Winter stone and frost
Prayer moves through frozen air
Winter does not speak
###
Prayer rises in cold
Water slips past silent stone
Silence answers back
