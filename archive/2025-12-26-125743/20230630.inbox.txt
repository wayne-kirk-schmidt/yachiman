Winter prayer starts
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Faith stays unbroken
###
God waits in silence
Prayer moves through frozen air
Silence answers back
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Stone remembers falling snow
Stillness endures
###
Winter water flows
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Water keeps its way
###
Stone river in frost
Water carries old prayers
The water moves
