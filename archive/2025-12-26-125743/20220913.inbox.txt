summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
cleanse the night air
sweep away the ancient; prepare
for the new bright dawn
###
Warm air moves softly
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
what can be done now?
with the that love has fallen
away from our sight?
###
pearls brilliant write
yet once were gnarled black soot beasts
and build up a shell
