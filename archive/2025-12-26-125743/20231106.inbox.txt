summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
footprint opens glass
wind slow dim ember sleep waits
distant warm empty
###
Heaven feels so near
Birds stitch their songs through thin fog
Nothing is kept now
###
lantern early wind
echo quiet valley wanders
shadow faint leans waits
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
