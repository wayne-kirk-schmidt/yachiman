summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
soft otera
silence breaks through otera
otera at rest
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
waits leaf stone wanders
water opens still passes
cold distant drifts dim
