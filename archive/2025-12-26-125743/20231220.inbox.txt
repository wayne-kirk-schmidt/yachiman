circles leaf footprint
rises wave ridge late silence
still ridge closes path
###
rabbits and new years
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
empty trees
silence slips through mountains
mountains unmoving
###
late distant bare wave
wind ridge slips lantern opens
settles early ridge
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
