distant beach
ember circles through beach
beach at rest
###
Children late for class,
books clutched tightly as they run,
trails laughter behind.
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift moon through
time pauses, listening
###
written pages help
us navigate murky shores
of our memory
###
breathes summer softly
mountains shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
