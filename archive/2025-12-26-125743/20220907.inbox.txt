breath. first small. then more.
then building then expanding
now filling sails and souls
###
winter and birth
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
I wait on the shore
looking to the horizon
waiting for my love
###
among the white tombs
see flowers cans and incense
for our ancestors
###
fingerprints and deer
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
