trees lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
rabbits lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
quiet soft slides snow
lingers silence settles dim
warm quiet rises leaf
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
