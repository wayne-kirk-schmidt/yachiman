summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
settles snow silence
glass slow lantern ember ridge
lingers drifts opens
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
warm oceans
path wanders through beach
rain returns
