Waves lean on the shore
Rain drums on roof and window
Memory hums now
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
fall lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
path wind shadow warm
rises lingers water wave
shore silence late bare
###
spiders lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
