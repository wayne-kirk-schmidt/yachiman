Gray stone holds the cold
Water carries old prayers
The water moves
###
Winter water flows
Water carries old prayers
The water moves
###
Cold prayer in winter
Water slips past silent stone
Stillness endures
###
Stone river in frost
God listens without reply
Faith stays unbroken
###
Stone river in frost
Gray clouds press on still rivers
The water moves
