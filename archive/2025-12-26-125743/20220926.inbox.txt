choose to love always
seek blessing, healing, and hope
a daily prayer
###
slow pale wave slides
slips wind echo wind glass drifts
water quiet slips dim
###
high warbling pitched
slow then fast, soft then louder
greeting the new dawn
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through moon
pauses, time listening
###
as our walls fall down
we wander in that rubble
selecting pieces
