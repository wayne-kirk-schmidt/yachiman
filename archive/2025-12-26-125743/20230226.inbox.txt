summer breathes softly
fireplace shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
jinja (shinto temple) lingers
quiet breath within borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
mountains and deer
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
