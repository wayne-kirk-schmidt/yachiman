summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
when solving problems
sometimes the best thing to do
is to walk backwards
###
ridge signal drifts ridge
echo echo waits wanders
footsteps footsteps slips
###
friendships built on threads
experience. understanding.
strong connections
###
sitting at the bar
perfect and fiercely shining
capturing my eyes
