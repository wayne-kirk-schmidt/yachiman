into memory
in mixed simple tranquil days
time thickly seasoned
###
Ghosts wait within hallways
Thread binds torn cloth back to whole
Care makes it strong now
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
splatter noisily
drops bounce and wiggle in streams
cooling the summer
###
brushes desperate
to say, to shout, and to sing
wait within the well
