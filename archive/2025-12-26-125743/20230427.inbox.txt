Bright sun warms the stone
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Light grows soft again
###
Hot pavement steams now
Wind moves across open fields
Day slips into rest
###
Summer rain begins
Light shifts over the water
Warm air comes to rest
###
Green fields drink the rain
Heat presses down on the land
The night comes in slow
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Shadows stretch at dusk
