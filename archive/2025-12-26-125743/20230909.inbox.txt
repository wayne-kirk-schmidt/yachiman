ridge signal cold wind
slips signal narrow slides
rises opens leaf
###
soft morning
clock opens through mountains
new years at rest
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
River's soft embrace
Surging waves splash on smooth rocks
Summer's calm delight
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
