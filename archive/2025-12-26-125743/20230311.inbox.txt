on the mountain top
patiently waiting huddled
for the sun's blessing
###
wave circles ridge ridge
warm footprint footprint slow ridge
valley still distant
###
old and denim shoes
clacking across hard wood floors
grandpa comes back home
###
Elder to younger
practitioners studying
clues signs and changes
###
how many species lived?
from the beginning till now?
how many more will?
