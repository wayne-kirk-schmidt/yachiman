passes wave waits bare
wind ridge folds opens opens
wanders late leaf glass
###
passes distant stone
cold stone holds slips leans closes
cold ember opens
###
Children laugh at dusk
Ice holds the world for a breath
Day trades begin now
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
