River hums in fog
Rain drums on roof and window
Hands grip the rail now
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
warm fireplace
ash holds through fireplace
fireplace alone
