summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
bare rabbits
leaf folds through doors
doors returns
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
quench blazing iron
hiss! the muted scream complains
into transforms peace
