summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
late winter
ash slips through beach
birds unmoving
###
Angels pass unseen
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Day waits its turn now
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
