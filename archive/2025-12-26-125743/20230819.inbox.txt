summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
Ghosts wait in hallways
Thread binds torn cloth back to whole
Care makes it strong now
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
path warm bare signal
settles ember slips leans waits
wave distant signal
