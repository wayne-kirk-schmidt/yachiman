Forest breathes in mist
Angels cross a quiet sky
Boots slow their pace now
###
warm otera
echo slides through rivers
rivers alone
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
ridge echo silence
ridge pale folds early bare slips
heavy wave settles
###
warm sun
thread folds through sun
midnight unmoving
