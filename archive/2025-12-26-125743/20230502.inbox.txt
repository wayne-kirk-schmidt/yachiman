Warm air moves softly
Light shifts over the water
Heat starts to drift off
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The long day slows down
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain moves across still water
The heat loosens grip
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Heat starts to drift off
