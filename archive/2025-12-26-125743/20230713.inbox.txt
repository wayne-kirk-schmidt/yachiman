summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
fingerprints and deer
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
opens faint opens
circles ridge soft soft empty
still rises circles
###
soft birthday
breath closes through summer
birthday unmoving
