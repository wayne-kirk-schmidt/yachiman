Hot pavement steams now
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The long day slows down
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain moves across still water
Evening slowing down
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The long day slows down
###
Quiet lake reflects
Wind moves across open fields
Time eases its hold
