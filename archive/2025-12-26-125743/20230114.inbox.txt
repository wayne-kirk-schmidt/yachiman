summer softly breathes
night shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
signal drifts passes
glass warm lantern shadow faint
circles holds water
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
cool soothing dark earth
swallows the day , consumes cares
offers peaceful rest
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
