take this in today
turning the corner quickly
shadows fading fast
###
drifts heavy late ridge
snow still lingers late distant
path lantern wanders
###
waves push to and fro
at seashore day, noon, and night
water always dancing
###
within the circle
woven carefully in plaits
are the threads of love
###
watching die ripples
changing green-grey to blue white
as the seconds pass
