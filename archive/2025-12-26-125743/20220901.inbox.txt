birds lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
empty sun
salt wanders through sun
sun breathing
###
we move through puddles
flowing around our footsteps
laughing all that time
###
Winter water flows
God listens without reply
The water moves
###
first glimpse of love
from fresh eyes just now opened
carries heavens song
