towers and high spires
castles of my mind sprawling
in perfect wonder
###
Warm wind bends the grass
bending Wind tall summer grass
Heat starts to drift off
###
sand sifts and slides down
dunes and beaches tumbling quick
join to the sea bed
###
write we codices
fill with secrets and puzzles
chasing mysteries
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
