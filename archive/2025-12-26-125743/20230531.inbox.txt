Soft mist lifts again
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Rain moves across still water
Warm air comes to rest
###
Hot pavement steams now
Wind bending tall summer grass
Time eases its hold
###
Green fields drink the rain
Heat presses down on the land
Day slips into rest
###
Green fields drink the rain
Heat presses down on the land
The night comes in slow
