shore ridge snow water
shore signal warm signal still
lingers wave soft waits
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
###
leans holds still late holds
echo heavy waits early
rises folds breaks drifts
###
midnight meets afternoon
footsteps gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
