Autumn leaves drift down
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Sleep stays nearby now
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
oceans lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
late heaven
shadow lingers through heaven
heaven alone
###
dim path breaks wanders
storms folds glass warm still ember
faint distant narrow
