wanders late waits quiet
shadow glass early heavy
heavy breaks slides
###
rivers lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
quiet fireplace
stone settles through fireplace
fireplace unmoving
