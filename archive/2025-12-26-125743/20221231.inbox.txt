my companion
sitting and and squawking looks
sitting on tree branch
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain carving lines in warm dust
air Warm comes to rest
###
steel alternating
between strength and supple form
built upon each stroke
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
lingers fall
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
