summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
Midday meal, bowls set
Boulders warm under noon sun
Day trades begin now
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
