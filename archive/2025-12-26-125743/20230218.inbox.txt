Empty wooden bench,
trains pass without a rider,
leaves dance on the floor.
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
walking water on
to his friend reaching for help
astonishing all
###
narrow mist
signal passes through mist
mist alone
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
