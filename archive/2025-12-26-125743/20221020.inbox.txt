the abbot whisks tea
and watches the swirls spinning
smiling at the zen
###
each new step we take
hearkens back to the old path
and gives us purpose
###
Hot pavement steams now
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The night comes in gentle
###
minimal dust specks
rolling along the floorboards
origin unknown
###
if we knew hardship,
when we started our journey,
what would that change now?
