closes glass distant
warm valley lantern lantern
echo wave rises
###
God waits in silence
God listens without reply
Winter does not speak
###
pressing, printing screeds
starkly outlined with the truth
thus revolts begin
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
Lantern guards the path,
foxes pause watch to the glow,
night deepens around.
