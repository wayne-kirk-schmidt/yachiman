morning narrow
path drifts through morning
morning unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
are miracles dead?
no. heaven everyday
provides help and aid
###
wind path shadow leaf
soft valley hancients warm signal
soft drifts empty warm
###
from the earth we plant
grow, love, water, and nurture
the fruits of the soul
