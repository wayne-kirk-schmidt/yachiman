still winter
echo drifts through winter
winter unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
pale dim settles stone
folds leaf breaks distant wanders
shore slow slips quiet wave
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
pale doors
water lingers through doors
doors at rest
