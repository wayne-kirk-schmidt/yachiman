early birds
snow opens through birds
birds returns
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
silence leaf late quiet
holds warm faint footprint early
cold slips faint echo
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
