summer softly breathes
doors shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
leaf heavy bare wave
opens bare leans lingers glass
signal footprint late
###
history does rhyme
trying verses and couplets
till the right one sticks
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows through drift afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
afternoon and midnight
two currents cross within stillness
time listens, unmoved
