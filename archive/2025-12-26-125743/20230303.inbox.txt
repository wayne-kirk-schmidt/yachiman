summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
opens closes bare
breaks water wanders path waits
rises holds empty
###
dim fog
ember slips through birthday
birthday returns
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
