Cloud shadows pass by
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hold
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Wind moves across open fields
Evening slowing down
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
Time eases its hold
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Warm air comes to rest
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Fog slithers between dark trees
Evening slowing down
