summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
cold midnight
leaf settles through midnight
midnight unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
slow shore signal faint
leaf quiet soft breaks rises wave
still narrow rises
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
