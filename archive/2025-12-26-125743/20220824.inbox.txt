cold birth
shore waits through mountains
birth at rest
###
Soft mist lifts again
Wind moves across open fields
Light grows soft again
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
hand small are searching
on the tabletop for pickles
then soon vanishing
###
the dice clack and bounce
of walls and dirt heralding
the advent of fate
