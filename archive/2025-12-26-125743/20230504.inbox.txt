Green fields drink the rain
Light shifts over the water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Warm air comes to rest
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Day slips into rest
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Wind bending tall summer grass
The heat loosens grip
###
Soft mist lifts again
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Light grows soft again
