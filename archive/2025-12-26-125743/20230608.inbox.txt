Quiet lake reflects
Heat presses down on the land
Time eases its hold
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Heat starts to drift off
###
Summer rain begins
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Light grows soft again
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Light shifts over the water
Light grows soft again
###
Soft mist lifts again
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The night comes in slow
