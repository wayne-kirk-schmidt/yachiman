summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
ridge quiet signal soft
leaf dim path drifts drifts passes
distant empty still
###
bare morning
shore closes through morning
morning unmoving
###
Autumn leaves drift down
Tengu glide on mountain air
Evening holds still now
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through trees
time pauses, listening
