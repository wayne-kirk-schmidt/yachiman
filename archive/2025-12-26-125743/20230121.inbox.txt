Baby breath is calm
Parents share a last small laugh
Water keeps pace now
###
I want our new love
to be better than the past
as well as lasting
###
harsh light and crisp air
the framing budding morning
possibilities
###
cannot see the end
and that is just fine to say
the play is that thing
###
replace my true face
fast one after another
till ewhat does remain?
