God walks winter paths
Prayer moves through frozen air
Silence answers back
###
spend the time today
to love something; care for it
cherish to it well
###
gear wheels are turning
merit accumulating
with each rotation
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
cycling in cities
provides backdrops of motion
balancing your thoughts
