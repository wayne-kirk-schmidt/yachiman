deer meets otera (buddhist temple)
trees gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
slips folds valley leaf
narrow opens heavy holds
pale echo faint wave
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
still dawn
valley opens through dawn
birds alone
