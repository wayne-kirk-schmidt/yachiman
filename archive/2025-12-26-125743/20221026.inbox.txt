ants move with purpose
seeking, probing, exploring
alone within vast hordes
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
when summer chills come
crisp air teasing around us
bringing memories
###
bare heaven
clock fades through heaven
rivers alone
###
did you still live there?
mere blocks from that destruction?
or did you escape?
