late distant bare wave
wind ridge slips lantern opens
settles early ridge
###
Can we rest our thoughts?
Take small a nap from the cares
or is that a dream?
###
wanders holds slips wave
quiet soft silence heavy pale
leaf cold wanders folds
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
###
water dries on that floor
as bathwater drains away slow
offering new hope
