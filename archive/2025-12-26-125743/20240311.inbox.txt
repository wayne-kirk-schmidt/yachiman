cold spring
wind wanders through spring
spring breathing
###
midnight and sun
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
pale birth
silence lingers through birth
birth breathing
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
