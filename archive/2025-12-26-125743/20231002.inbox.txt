leaf slips fades breaks
warm pale footprint faint wind late
holds drifts circles waits
###
beach and otera (buddhist temple)
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
bare drifts folds echo
stone faint path settles narrow
footprint leaf ridge slips
###
still birth
thread drifts through birth
birth alone
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
