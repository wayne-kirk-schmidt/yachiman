cold mountains
paper leans through night
night alone
###
dim lantern ember
quiet folds wind rises closes
dim valley bare path
###
wind settles ember
rises valley cold opens
drifts passes slides
###
winter and birth
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
narrow mist
signal passes through mist
mist alone
