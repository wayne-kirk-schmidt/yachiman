Soft mist lifts again
Wind moves across open fields
Heat starts to drift off
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Fog slithers between dark trees
The night comes in slow
###
Green fields drink the rain
Fog slithers between dark trees
Day slips into rest
###
Quiet lake reflects
Heat presses down on the land
Warm air comes to rest
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Wind bending tall summer grass
The heat loosens grip
