wind rattles the gate
each hinge sings of passing time
seasons shift again
###
leaf slips fades breaks
warm pale footprint faint wind late
holds drifts circles waits
###
what could you expect?
slow time? stop? even reverse?
no. pursue your path.
###
snakes slithering up
combining and frolicking
snakes slithering down
###
If I around walk
What will I see? Fresh new growth?
Or Potemkin walls?
