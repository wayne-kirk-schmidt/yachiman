watching that water
can freeze in midair falling
into frigid mist
###
Spring equinox dawns
Mountains cut the clouds in halves
Forest remembers
###
pausing my breathing
white whisps one then two then more
to in see winter
###
soft morning
clock opens through mountains
new years at rest
###
pages stand silent
and readily accepting
scribe student alike
