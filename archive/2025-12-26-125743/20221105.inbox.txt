Thunder in the hills,
rain hurries across the fields,
cattle rush for home.
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through noon
time listening pauses,
###
sunken, forgotten
the wreck shows its bones to us
as if to say "come"
###
I shall not hate you
I will watch, learn, and defend
will I study peace
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
