Winter water flows
Prayer moves through frozen air
Winter does not speak
###
opens still shadow
breaks shadow shadow folds faint
slips slips ridge settles
###
forests and footsteps
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
