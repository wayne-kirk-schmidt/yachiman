closes breaks footprint
holds waits glass lantern lingers
late wind lantern cold
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
Oni grin at gates
Moon hangs above sleeping roofs
Time leans forward now
###
wind signal valley
quiet opens leans water cold
waits closes lantern
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
