empty mountains
valley fades through mountains
mountains alone
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
Evening meal is shared
Flame writes bright notes on the air
Day closes tight now
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
