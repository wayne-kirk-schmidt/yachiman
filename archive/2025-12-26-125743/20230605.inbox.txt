Warm air moves softly
Rain moves across still water
Evening slowing down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Fog drifts across the valley
Time eases its hold
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
Time eases its hold
###
Hot pavement steams now
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Heat starts to drift off
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Rain moves across still water
The night comes in slow
