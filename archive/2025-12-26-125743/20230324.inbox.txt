summer breathes softly
midnight shadows through drift new years
time pauses, listening
###
each path can be blessed
by or faith grace or wisdom
each to each their path
###
slow early echo
opens pale leans wave passes
spring water drifts folds
###
teaching me lyrics
notes floating down and from you
swirling audio
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
