Gray stone holds the cold
Water carries old prayers
Faith stays unbroken
###
God waits in silence
Water carries old prayers
The water moves
###
Winter water flows
Water slips past silent stone
Faith stays unbroken
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Cold hands touch running water
The water moves
###
Cold stone by the stream
God listens without reply
Faith stays unbroken
