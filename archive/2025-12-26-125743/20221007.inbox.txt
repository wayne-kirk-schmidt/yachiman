we need our first steps
to see where we started from
to plan where to go
###
I would build a world
within my own. special. rare.
helping others see
###
and stately profound
starting the measure building
the notes lingering
###
working in gardens
planting seeds and pruning trees
create green wonders
###
fireplace meets heaven
spiders gathers at the threshold
silence hancients its shape
