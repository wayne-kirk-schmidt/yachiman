stone slides ember
slips leaf slips water narrow
snow fades waits still
###
narrow fog
salt drifts through storms
storms unmoving
###
birth lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
passes faint heavy
waits late settles slips path cold
dim settles opens
