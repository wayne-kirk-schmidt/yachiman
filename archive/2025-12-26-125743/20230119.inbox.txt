Children laugh at dusk
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Plans gently fade now
###
summer softly breathes
rivers shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
new years meets rabbits
moon gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Fog slithers between dark trees
Heat starts to drift off
###
can we move this now?
the stone created from decades
actions of long done
