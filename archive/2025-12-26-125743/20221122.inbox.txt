Cloud shadows pass by
Light shifts over the water
Day slips into rest
###
empty fireplace
silence settles through fingerprints
fireplace at rest
###
lantern late silence
stone late valley ember still
distant folds dim waits
###
touch on the far shores
with hands your touching soft sands
first to make landfall
###
paper shaped lightning
on pillars of the spirits
giving their blessing
