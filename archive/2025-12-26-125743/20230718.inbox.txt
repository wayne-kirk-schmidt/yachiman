afternoon and spiders
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
closes signal cold
shore waits fades soft lingers
settles soft waits late
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
Ghosts wait in hallways
Sea salt stays on tired skin
Lungs fill with light now
