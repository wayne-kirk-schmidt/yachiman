rises signal soft
wave faint early wanders dim
ember still shore path
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
Spring wind lifts petals
Counting hours without haste
Stories return now
###
slips soft lingers pale
bare closes heavy echo
opens path snow sun
###
Evening meal is shared
Smoke trails into starry dark
Day letting go slowly now
