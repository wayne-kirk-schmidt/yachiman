summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
Baby breath is calm
Parents share a last small laugh
Water keeps pace now
###
empty valley drifts
settles doors slides slips dim
snow narrow early
###
still spiders
stone circles through spiders
spiders unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
