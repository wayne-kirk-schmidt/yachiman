Green fields drink the rain
Wind bending tall summer grass
Evening slowing down
###
we do not think this
we do not see or feel that
but we are here now
###
wind folds cold opens
bare slow bare wanders circles
path rises settles
###
I tell you then write!
what Write is being spoken
and then spread that news
###
smiling we welcome
the newborn into our world
dreaming of future
