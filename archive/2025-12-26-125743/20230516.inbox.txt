Bright sun warms the stone
Wind moves across open fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain moves across still water
Day slips into rest
###
Quiet lake reflects
Wind moves across open fields
Time eases its hold
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Fog drifts across the valley
The long day slows down
###
Soft mist lifts again
Light shifts over the water
Light grows soft again
