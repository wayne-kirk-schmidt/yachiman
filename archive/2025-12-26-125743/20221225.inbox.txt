Hot pavement steams now
Wind bending tall summer grass
Day slips into rest
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Wind bending tall summer grass
Light grows soft again
###
distant oceans
valley drifts through oceans
heaven breathing
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift windows through
time pauses, listening
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog slithers between dim trees
Heat starts to drift off
