Warm wind bends grass the
Heat presses down on the land
Evening slowing down
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
along the dry steppes
from mountains to desert valleys
move horse and rider
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hold
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Cold hands touch running water
The water moves
