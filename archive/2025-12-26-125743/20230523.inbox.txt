Soft mist lifts again
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Warm air comes to rest
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hold
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Evening slowing down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind moves across open fields
The night comes in slow
###
Green fields drink the rain
Wind bending tall summer grass
Evening slowing down
