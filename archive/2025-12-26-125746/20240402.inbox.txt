summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
birthday and spiders
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
wind ridge valley leans
soft path shore snow bare ridge pale
leaf ember valley
###
fireplace lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
