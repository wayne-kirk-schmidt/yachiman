passes holds glass bare
cold dim echo shadow breaks
lantern bare passes
###
circles water drifts
warm shore glass path closes shore
soft lingers circles
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
