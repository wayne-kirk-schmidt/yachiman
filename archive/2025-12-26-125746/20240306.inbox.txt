summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
Flame leans into night
Tengu glide on mountain air
Heat returns slow now
###
rabbits lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
