simple wrappers sit
hinting at rice and, of fish
a meal well enjoyed
###
new years lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
working with numbers
changes are so beautiful
showing new patterns
###
pure water settles
into the spreading being,
healing, strengthening
