summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
winter and stars
two currents cross in stillness
listens, time unmoved
###
warm oceans
path wanders through beach
rain returns
###
second hands racing
minute hands waltz serenely
while hours march onward
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
