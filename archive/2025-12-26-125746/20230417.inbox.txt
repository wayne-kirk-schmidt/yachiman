summer softly breathes
doors shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
simple white holding watch
where seagulls float serenely
over ink-black seashores
###
from rock thus to egg
to heartfelt life; all things strive
and seek completion
###
night lingers
silent breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
three blue one grey
stones piled; silent pyramids
marking the pathway
