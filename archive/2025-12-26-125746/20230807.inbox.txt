distant footsteps
glass slides through footsteps
footsteps alone
###
drifts faint cold shore wind
signal signal narrow shore
bare shore still echo
###
birth and deer
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
