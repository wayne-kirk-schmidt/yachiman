summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
narrow dawn
ridge fades through oceans
dawn breathing
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
afternoon and midnight
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
