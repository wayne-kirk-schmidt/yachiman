trees and storms
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
pale warm breaks slides
ridge breaks passes mist footprint
snow wind soft early
###
prize out that caring
from the buildings of our lives
to help build new rooms
###
trees and storms
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
