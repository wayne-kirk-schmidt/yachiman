summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
thus once in motion
the pendulum swings first to
then always returns
###
lingers rabbits
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
can it be better?
small cakes and joyful singing
for me, this is best
###
rain Summer begins
Light shifts over the water
The long day slows down
