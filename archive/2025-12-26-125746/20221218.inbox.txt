I wish we had time
to review and discuss now
yet we have the past
###
I did not know it
the time when you said goodbye
I but felt it pass
###
If we were on mars
we look at that earth and moon
looking out and back
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
you must remember!
says the line of ghosts onshore
as the waves recede
