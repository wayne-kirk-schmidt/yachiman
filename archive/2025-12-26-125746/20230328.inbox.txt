lingers late closes
closes glass glass leaf wind cold
early holds shadow
###
Springtime trains return,
cherry blossoms greet the doors,
petals the ride wind.
###
nothing pushes back
when looking within the void
the circle is wide
###
driving the dark roads
winding tunnel of your path
plunges in unknown
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
