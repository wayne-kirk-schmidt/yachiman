afternoon and spring
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
stone early still breaks
ridge doors echo settles bare
echo opens wave
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
