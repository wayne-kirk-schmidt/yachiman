forests lingers
breath quiet in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
sleep and rain
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
Forest breathes in mist
Tengu glide on mountain air
Day waits its turn now
###
Warm air moves softly
Wind moves across open fields
Heat starts to drift off
###
words are flighty things
they squeak and flutter and flit
around all of us
