Summer solstice burns
Sun climbs over frost and mud
Stars begin twice now
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through oceans
time pauses, listening
###
storms lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
quiet soft slides snow
lingers silence settles dim
warm quiet rises leaf
###
the keen eyes spot it
a speck in ocean, in sky
moving closer now
