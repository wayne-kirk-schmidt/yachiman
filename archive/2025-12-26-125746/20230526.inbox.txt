Warm wind bends the grass
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The long day slows down
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Wind moves across open fields
Heat starts to drift off
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Warm air moves softly
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Hot pavement steams now
Fog slithers between dark trees
The long day slows down
