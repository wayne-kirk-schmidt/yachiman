summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
echo pale early
warm shadow still valley bare
leaf narrow leaf snow
###
leans ridge folds closes
heavy soft settles quiet dim
holds quiet cold shore faint
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
distant beach
ember circles through beach
beach at rest
