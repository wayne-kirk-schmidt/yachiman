fades snow wave waits
cold closes rises narrow
distant opens breaks
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
soft storms
ash opens through storms
storms alone
###
sun lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
