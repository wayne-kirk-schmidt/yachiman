crimson river runs
where the maple’s tears have fallen
time dissolves within flow
###
Midday meal, bowls set
Boulders warm under noon sun
Day trades begin now
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through footsteps
time listening pauses,
###
When you look at stars
winking, glittering at night
history dancing
