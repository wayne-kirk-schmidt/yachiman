Thin fog drifts at dawn
Fog slithers between dark trees
Heat starts to drift off
###
Soft mist lifts again
Light shifts over the water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Light grows soft again
###
Summer rain begins
Light shifts over the water
Day slips into rest
###
Soft mist lifts again
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The heat loosens grip
