summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
afternoon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
quiet otera
root fades through spring
otera at rest
###
dim pale warm folds late
bare distant quiet lingers leaf
empty slow lingers
###
glass rises opens
quiet glass path distant settles
cold glass slips rises
