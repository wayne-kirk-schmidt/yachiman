summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
faint passes slides
wave soft snow holds passes waits
folds lantern holds warm
###
dim noon
thread opens through birthday
birthday returns
###
narrow breaks circles
water soft empty ember
rain water shore slow
###
Angels pass unseen
Rivers braid through stones and reeds
Light enters fast now
