Cold moon above pines
Flame writes bright notes on the air
Evening holds still now
###
doors lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
fog lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
heavy birds
wood settles through birds
birds unmoving
