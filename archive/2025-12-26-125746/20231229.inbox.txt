summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
cold rivers
shadow leans through rivers
heaven unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
River flows steady,
Surging past rocks with soft splash,
Warm waves kiss the shore,
