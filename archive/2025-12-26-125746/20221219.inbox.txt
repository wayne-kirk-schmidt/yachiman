summer breathes softly
dawn shadows through drift birds
time pauses, listening
###
I shall not go slow
nor am I able to close
my heart or my eyes
###
dunes shift and waver
following the winds bidding
remembering home
###
path early signal
faint folds late heavy early
drifts slips folds early
###
simplest soup pots filled
herbs, fish, and vegetables
simmer and beckon
