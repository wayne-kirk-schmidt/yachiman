wind settles ember
valley rises cold opens
drifts passes slides
###
breathes summer softly
morning shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
storm clouds gather quick
folding shadows over fields
lightning waits its turn
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
approaching slowly
hunter and prey moving linked
with pending purpose
