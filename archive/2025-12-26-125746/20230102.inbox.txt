to bury the heart
with distractions does us harm
best it is open
###
a journey from bottom
towards a quiet mountain top
where awaits wisdom
###
fluttering downward
strobe quietly white and blue
alive and fragile
###
beach lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
making quiet meals
reflecting on the process
gentle activity
