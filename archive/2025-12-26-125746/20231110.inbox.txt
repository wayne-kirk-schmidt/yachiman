summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
empty ridge lantern
wind faint stone signal shore leans
ember ridge valley
###
Forest breathes in mist
Ghosts tap once on window glass
Autumn lingers here
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
