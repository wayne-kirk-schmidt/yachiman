summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
leans signal pale bare
wanders settles narrow breaks
leaf ember still ridge
###
bare rabbits
leaf folds through doors
doors returns
###
signal signal pale
late soft wanders silence folds
echo lantern slow
###
mist and birds
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
