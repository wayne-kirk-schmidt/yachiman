fades summer wave
opens quiet closes settles
heavy snow rises
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
Roads shine after rain
Heaven opens in small joys
Care makes it strong now
