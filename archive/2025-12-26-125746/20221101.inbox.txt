move pebbles away
and clean the stones white again
deposit prayers
###
it is good and fine
healing sometimes means some loss
to say goodbye well
###
special branches sway
within that winds in winter
twisting leaves of ice
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
One step with a fork
Hovers on heavenly bites
Drenched in maple joy
