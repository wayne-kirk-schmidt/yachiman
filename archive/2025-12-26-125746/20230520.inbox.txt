Hot pavement steams now
Heat presses down on the land
Warm air comes to rest
###
Green fields drink the rain
Fog drifts across the valley
Heat starts to drift off
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
Warm air comes to rest
###
Soft mist lifts again
Fog slithers between dark trees
Day slips into rest
###
Summer rain begins
Fog drifts across the valley
The night comes in slow
