lingers sun
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
moon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
The pond’s face, quiet
reflecting a startled bird,
ripples scatter sky.
###
seven times around
circling, part of a whole
faithful are walking
###
house after house sit
on streets darkened by our fear
waiting for love's light
