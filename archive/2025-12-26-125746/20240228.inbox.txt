fingerprints lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
dawn meets mountains
beach gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
settles ridge passes
faint path quiet shore late faint wave
cold holds soft ember
