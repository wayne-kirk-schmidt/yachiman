rain lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
still storms
wood slips through storms
storms returns
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
circles passes shore
circles echo rises warm
passes waits shadow
