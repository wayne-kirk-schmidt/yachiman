early silence drifts
ridge quiet lingers leaf footprint
heavy cold early
###
fireplace lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
storms lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through rivers
time pauses, listening
###
early summer
stone lingers through summer
summer at rest
