Midday meal, bowls set
Sea salt stays on tired skin
Season turns twice now
###
Morning bells ringing,
people rushing the down street,
footsteps blur like rain.
###
simple notes held high
lingering, pleading with us
descending to earth
###
twelve beans arranged
across  heaven's long table
a soup for all months
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm air comes to rest
