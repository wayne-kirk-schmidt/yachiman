slides bare signal
early holds shore soft closes
waits pale warm narrow
###
what could we now do?
move the stone or speak in tongues?
holding mustard seeds
###
Abbot, what is dharma?
while sweeping slowly smiling
he "all, said yet none"
###
now I shut the book
and put my head down to sleep
till our next day comes
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
