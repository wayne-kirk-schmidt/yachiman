summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through rivers
time pauses, listening
###
glass rain snow snow stone
leans circles wave stone passes
breaks silence heavy
###
distant mountains
current wanders through spiders
mountains breathing
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
