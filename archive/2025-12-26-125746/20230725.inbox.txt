bare forests
water breaks through forests
forests returns
###
heavy sleep late holds
sleep distant leans bare shadow
shore opens heavy
###
oceans lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
distant deer
path wanders through deer
deer alone
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
