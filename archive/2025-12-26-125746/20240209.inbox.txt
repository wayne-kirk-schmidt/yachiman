Sun warms the river
River turns under old bridge
Care makes it strong now
###
water faint stars late
closes leaf pale folds warm still
quiet shore pale bare slow
###
early midnight
wind holds through midnight
midnight returns
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
