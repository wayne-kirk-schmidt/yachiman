summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
still dim signal breaks
holds still early lingers leans
wanders bare rises
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
