God walks winter paths
Water carries old prayers
Stillness endures
###
Winter stone and frost
God listens without reply
Faith stays unbroken
###
Cold water on stone
Water carries old prayers
Water keeps its way
###
Winter water flows
Prayer moves through frozen air
Winter does not speak
###
Winter prayer begins
Cold hands touch running water
Silence answers back
