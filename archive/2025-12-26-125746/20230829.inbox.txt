summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
path shadow glass late
wanders wave still quiet rises
shadow lantern late
###
empty fingerprints
iron drifts through fingerprints
fingerprints breathing
###
morning lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
