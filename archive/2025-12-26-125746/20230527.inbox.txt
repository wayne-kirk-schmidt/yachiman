Bright sun warms the stone
Light shifts over the water
Evening slowing down
###
Soft mist lifts again
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
Summer rain begins
Wind bending tall summer grass
The night comes in slow
###
Summer rain begins
Rain moves across still water
Light grows soft again
###
Soft mist lifts again
Wind bending tall summer grass
Time eases its hold
