late rises bare holds
lingers wanders wind lantern
lingers echo slips
###
passes breaks water
wanders drifts footprint narrow
ridge rises leaf leans
###
Noon rests over fields
Parents share a last small laugh
Evening holds still now
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
Spring equinox dawns
Kami wait in cedar shade
Salt rests on skin now
