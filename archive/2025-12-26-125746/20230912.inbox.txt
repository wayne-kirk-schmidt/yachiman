faint slides slips holds
waits early echo bare leaf
wind distant circles
###
trees and jinja (shinto temple)
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
trees lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
