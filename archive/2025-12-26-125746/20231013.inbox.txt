summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
cloud passes lingers
opens drifts distant rises
slides dim opens
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
pale heaven
path folds through forests
forests breathing
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
