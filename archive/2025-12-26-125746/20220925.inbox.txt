stepping in the dust
swirling on the cold sidewalks
is what that remains
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Wind bending tall summer grass
Heat starts to drift off
###
summer breathes softly
spring drift shadows through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
Hot pavement steams now
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
summer breathes softly
fog drift shadows through footsteps
time pauses, listening
