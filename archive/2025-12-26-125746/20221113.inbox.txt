and I read the book
within holds matters of life
I and consider
###
summer's gravid heat
weighing on the brow and soul
yields to gentle rains
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through night
time listening pauses,
###
rain and stars
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
Cold stone by the stream
Prayer moves through frozen air
Faith stays unbroken
