summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
closes early warm
quiet lantern ridge snow slips faint
soft stone opens bare
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
afternoon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
