Hot pavement steams now
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The long day slows down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Rain moves across still water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Wind moves across open fields
Heat starts to drift off
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Light shifts over the water
The heat loosens grip
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Light shifts over the water
Day slips into rest
