fades soft shadow
lingers distant folds passes
shore wanders wave doors
###
Midnight holds its breath
Rain drums on roof and window
Evening holds still now
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
cold fall
wood rises through fall
fog breathing
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
