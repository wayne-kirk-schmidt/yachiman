summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
Frozen garden path,
steps crunch heavy in the frost,
roses sleep in ice.
###
walkways here are bright
shining with warm sunlight
within newfound joy
###
we keen for small things
and wish for the past sometimes
tears shed for changes
