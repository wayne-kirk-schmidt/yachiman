blue leap sparks and dance
building courage to break free
speeding towards ground
###
first slicing that edge
the knife seeks the deepest heart
carving the short cake
###
wrapping packages
caring and devotional
offered to others
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
trolls under bridges
watching, helping, and guiding
unlikely helpers
