slower and slower
red beats become blue whispers
and then memories
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Rain moves across still water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
moving past actions
to see people building new
appreciation
###
warm fresh years
ridge folds through mountains
mountains returns
###
pulling overcoats
defending against winter
grey and grey mixing
