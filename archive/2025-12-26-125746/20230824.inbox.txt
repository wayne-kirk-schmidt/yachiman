glass slips circles warm
lantern shore soft valley shore
slow pale stone heavy
###
ridge signal drifts ridge
echo echo waits wanders
footsteps footsteps slips
###
rain meets rivers
birth gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
empty wind ember
footprint ridge early empty
leans opens ridge slips
