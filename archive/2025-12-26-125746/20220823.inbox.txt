Quiet lake reflects
Heat presses down on the land
Time eases its hold
###
fall and new years
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind bending tall summer grass
Time eases its hold
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
afternoon and spring
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
