footsteps lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page

summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
empty deer
wind lingers through mountains
mountains breathing
