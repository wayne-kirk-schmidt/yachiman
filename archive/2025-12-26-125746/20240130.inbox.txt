summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
still glass water stone
passes holds heavy shadow
faint cold ember leans
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
noon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
mist lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
