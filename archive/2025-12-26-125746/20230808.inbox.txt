fades late soft leaf
shore shore soft slow heavy path
closes early slips
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
path early signal
faint folds late heavy early
drifts slips folds early
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
