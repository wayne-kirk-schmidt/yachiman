summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
slow pale breaks holds snow
dim folds dim signal fades
narrow echo holds
###
warm lingers distant
ember slow late slides holds
drifts wanders valley
###
new years lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
