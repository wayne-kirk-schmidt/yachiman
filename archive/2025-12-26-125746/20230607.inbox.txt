Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The night comes in slow
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Light grows soft again
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog drifts across the valley
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind moves across open fields
Day slips into rest
