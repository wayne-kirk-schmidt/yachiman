standing in stark lines
queueing their for sea entry
penguins lithely move
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
grows Light soft again
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through deer
pauses, time listening
###
we could spend that month
filled with glorious mornings
exploring each other
###
within a mirror
lie beauty and lurk danger
both equally seen
