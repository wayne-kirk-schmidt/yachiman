flows river slower
mirroring a broken sky
scattered with red leaves
###
Night sea breathes slowly
Thread binds torn cloth back to whole
Shadows grow tall now
###
Waves lean on the shore
Rain drums on roof and window
Time leans forward now
###
new cuts now healing
walking within future and past
building memory
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
