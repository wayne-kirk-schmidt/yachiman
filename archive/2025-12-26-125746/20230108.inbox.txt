ember slides faint
path fades snow dim slips drifts
passes cold narrow
###
passes ridge settles
closes dim silence soft still
leaf fall ridge holds leans
###
no, we can find peace
resting in the spaces between
love, anger, and loss
###
breathes summer softly
mountains shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
