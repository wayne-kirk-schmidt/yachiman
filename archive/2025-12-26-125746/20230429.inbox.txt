Thin fog drifts at dawn
Fog drifts across the valley
The long day slows down
###
Summer rain begins
Light shifts over the water
Heat starts to drift off
###
Green fields drink the rain
Fog drifts across the valley
Warm air comes to rest
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog slithers between dark trees
Heat starts to drift off
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Light shifts over the water
Time eases its hold
