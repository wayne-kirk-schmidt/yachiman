Old boulders keep watch
A prayer rises with incense
Memory hums now
###
wind quiet passes still
otera cold slides drifts
early shore circles
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
sleep lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
