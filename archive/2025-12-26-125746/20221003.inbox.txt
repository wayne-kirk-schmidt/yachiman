write discoveries
on paper, your heart and stone
so others may learn
###
grey abounds outside
and holds up sunrises till
reds and golds blossom
###
chapters are written
after love sometimes before
on books in our hearts
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
Snow veils the bare road
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Care makes it strong now
