summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
soft bare wanders snow
distant water breaks faint wind
pale footprint holds night
###
Thread pulls through soft cloth
Rocks keep the shape of old time
Sleep stays nearby now
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
