summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
holds passes empty
silence drifts wanders slow waits
pale distant bare shore
###
early doors
wind fades through doors
jinja alone
###
Midday meal, bowls set
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Faith walks ahead now
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
