Winter water flows
Water carries ancient prayers
The water moves
###
heaven lingers
quiet breath within borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
decisions flow well
upon the bridge of reason
holding hands with faith
###
Cold prayer in winter
Cancient hands touch running water
Water keeps its way
###
no message will come
yet a response is heart held
and reaches us all
