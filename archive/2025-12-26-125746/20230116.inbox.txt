gazing at the stars
and possibly beyond them?
what we see is light
###
path distant lingers
breaks cold ember silence faint
closes warm signal
###
water slips lingers
bare path silence distant path
shore lingers footprint
###
go past tired bodies
push forward into the grey
sleep will come later
###
slips fades distant
holds ember shore soft rises
faint soft shore cold leans
