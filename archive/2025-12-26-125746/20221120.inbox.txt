throw the stone across
laughing water quivering
joy quiet ringing
###
the key is balance
live your life or carve buddha
seek the middle path
###
four years in one day
one night along that shoreline
waves move with relief
###
Winter crow calls twice,
the sound lingers in the cold,
tree branches shiver.
###
narrow glass bare drifts
path slips dim holds water slow
waits empty ridge slow
