summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
narrow morning
glass lingers through morning
morning breathing
###
slow wave fades holds
valley faint cold ridge water
fades still fades
###
birthday lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
