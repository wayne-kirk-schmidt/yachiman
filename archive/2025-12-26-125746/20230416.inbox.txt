and yet we are here
pushing on with all our strength
against moving seas
###
the writing scriptures
recollection from before
discussing great things
###
Cracked mirror in hands,
fragments show a thousand eyes,
none are truly mine.
###
late rivers
echo wanders through rivers
rivers returns
###
offered in service
bread and wine to the faithful
which nurtures their faith
