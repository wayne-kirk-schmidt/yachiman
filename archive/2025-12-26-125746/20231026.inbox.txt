Smoke curls from the hearth
Rain drums on roof and window
Season turns twice now
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
winter lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
heaven and jinja (shinto temple)
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
