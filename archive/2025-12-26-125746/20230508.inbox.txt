Cloud shadows pass by
Wind bending tall summer grass
Heat starts to drift off
###
Soft mist lifts again
Wind moves across open fields
Light grows soft again
###
Warm air moves softly
Light shifts over the water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain moves across still water
Day slips into rest
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Rain moves across still water
The heat loosens grip
