clarity of sutras
do not change our firm duty
seek and help others
###
settles snow silence
glass slow lantern ember ridge
lingers opens drifts
###
trees shadow distant
lingers footprint path wanders
drifts glass fancients heavy
###
narrow fog
salt drifts through storms
unmoving storms
###
from the mountain top
we leap and soar or plummet
on based confidence
