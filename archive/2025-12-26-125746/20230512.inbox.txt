Warm wind bends the grass
Fog drifts across the valley
Light grows soft again
###
Summer rain begins
Heat presses down on the land
Light grows soft again
###
Hot pavement steams now
Light shifts over the water
Warm air comes to rest
###
Hot pavement steams now
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Time eases its hold
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Light grows soft again
