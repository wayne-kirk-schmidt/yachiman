Cold water on stone
Stone remembers falling snow
Water keeps its way
###
Winter water flows
Stone remembers falling snow
Stillness endures
###
Cold stone by the stream
Water slips past silent stone
Water keeps its way
###
Cold water on stone
Water slips past silent stone
The water moves
###
Winter water flows
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Stillness endures
