fingerprints lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
splendidly shining
the skull glitters from the loam
telling great stories
###
still lantern wanders
slips valley path slow wanders
water footprint drifts
###
along a pier and shore
staring into dim places
heart slowly healing
###
echo circles slow
footprint slips wanders leaf shore
stone lantern distant
