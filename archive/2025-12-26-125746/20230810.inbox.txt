summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
ridge glass snow distant
rises silence slides waits
leaf valley drifts breaks
###
narrow spiders
glass leans through winter
spiders returns
###
valley quiet ridge cold
settles holds late holds breaks slips
lantern silence breaks
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
