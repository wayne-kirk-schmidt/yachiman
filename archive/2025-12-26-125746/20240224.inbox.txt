slips water circles
wanders glass narrow wanders
soft lantern circles
###
rain lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
dim trees
clock lingers through trees
trees alone
