of course! love is there
infusing optimism
swirling with our tea
###
focus on the shrine
grey and gold in the morning
speaking with heaven
###
in the deepest woods
dancing and twirling dawn at
scattering cold leaves
###
when I stomp my foot
I look to scare fierce things off
from our reflections
###
contemplating leaves
from tree to ground and to soil
and begins anew
