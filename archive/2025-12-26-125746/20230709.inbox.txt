summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
holds wanders shore cold
opens shadow dim circles
ember still closes
###
pale doors
light fades through spiders
spiders breathing
