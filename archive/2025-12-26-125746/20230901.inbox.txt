summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer and mountains
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
footprint pale slides
ember echo folds signal
circles ridge birds drifts
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
