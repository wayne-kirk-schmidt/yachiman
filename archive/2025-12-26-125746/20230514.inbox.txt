Hot pavement steams now
Wind bending tall summer grass
Evening slowing down
###
Warm air moves softly
Rain moves across still water
The night comes in slow
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
Summer rain begins
Rain moves across still water
Light grows soft again
###
Hot pavement steams now
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Evening slowing down
