puddle Spring reflects,
children leap across its face,
laughter breaks the sky.
###
crumbling the sand
starts out with just single grains
cascading further
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
leans lantern breaks warm
signal leaf fades leans still
lantern slow empty
