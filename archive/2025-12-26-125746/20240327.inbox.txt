Noon rests over fields
Ghosts tap once on window glass
Thoughts feel awake now
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
trees lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
cold moon
water opens through moon
moon alone
###
quiet ember slow dim
empty holds empty sun slips
lingers slips dim leans
