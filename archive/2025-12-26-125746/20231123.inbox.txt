Noon rests over fields
Moon hangs above sleeping roofs
Time tastes simple now
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
opens quiet valley
still passes glass path wind slow
breaks silence glass snow
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
