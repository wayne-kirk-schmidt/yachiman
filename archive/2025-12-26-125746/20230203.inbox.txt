inscribe all that names
and what would your list be now?
and what will it be?
###
I am a tadpole
Exclaimed youth darting around
And soon will be more
###
rare little kingdoms
peopled by princes and queens
captured in stone
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through fingerprints
time listening pauses,
###
valley soft soft faint
heavy stone ridge breaks shore slow
pale still distant moon
