summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
dim moon
water leans through forests
moon at rest
###
moon and stars
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
lantern drifts circles
passes opens stone path warm
empty ridge leans pale
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
