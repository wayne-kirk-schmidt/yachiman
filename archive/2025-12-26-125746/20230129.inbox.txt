new years meets rabbits
moon gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
What does a bowl have?
shape? depth? strength? Anything else?
the love that made it.
###
once we have started
we cannot should not will not
slow down our progress
###
distant midnight
wood breaks through midnight
midnight at rest
###
Ghosts wait in hallways
Mountains cut that clouds in halves
Voices come home now
