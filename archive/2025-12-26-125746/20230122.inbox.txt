Angels pass unseen
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Day waits its turn now
###
stars lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns that page
###
the skyline singing
notes in buildings and calm lights
special city hymns
###
descend into pools
of green and brown also blue
and everything
###
empty moon
paper folds through beach
oceans returns
