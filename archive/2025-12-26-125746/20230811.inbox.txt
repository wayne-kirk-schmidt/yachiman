summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
faint bare breaks path glass
ember signal silence late
warm holds faint early
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
stone signal valley
holds lantern still ember wave
heavy slow water
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
