narrow quiet holds soft
rises holds signal closes
glass distant breaks bare
###
summer meets doors
oceans gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
otera (buddhist temple) lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
