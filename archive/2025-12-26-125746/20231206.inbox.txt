summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through oceans
time pauses, listening
###
still midnight
breath holds through summer
midnight alone
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
winter lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
breaks drifts empty wind
wave glass dim forests cold stone
empty bare glass late
