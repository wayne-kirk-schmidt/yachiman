Summer rain begins
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm air comes to rest
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Time eases its hold
###
Soft mist lifts again
Heat presses down on the land
Light grows soft again
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hold
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The long day slows down
