lantern slow silence
closes ember opens waits
drifts lingers opens
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
water wind signal
heavy wave lantern ridge shore
lantern leaf soft path
###
oceans and forests
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
