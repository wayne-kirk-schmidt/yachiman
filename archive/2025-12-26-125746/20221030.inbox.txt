soft new years
ash waits through new years
new years returns
###
look at life within time
see life with life side by side
and how it compares
###
oceans and fingerprints
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
midnight meets afternoon
footsteps gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
regarding footsteps
millions years of old and yet
you can see purpose
