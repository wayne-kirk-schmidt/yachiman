summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
not that we know it
but we connect with others
and they also us
###
breathes summer softly
forests shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
at last the nighttime
lay my head down and reflect
on previous day
###
skipping on water
the stone speeds along bouncing
one five seven gone
