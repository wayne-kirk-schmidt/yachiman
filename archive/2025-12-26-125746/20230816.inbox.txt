snow folds folds water
sun sun folds wind distant snow
wind dim waits valley
###
Baby breath is calm
Smoke trails into starry dark
Time leans forward now
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through trees
time pauses, listening
###
distant windows
bell passes through windows
windows at rest
###
late ember shadow
footprint wind drifts glass heavy
echo folds early
