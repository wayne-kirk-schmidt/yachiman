heavy birds
clock slips heaven through
birds returns
###
the mold takes raw clay
and, with time and care, hardens
a vessel for more
###
cicadas calling
the heat trembles in the air
time stands in their song
###
slow settles quiet glass
still wave still signal path waits
distant dim folds drifts
###
holds ridge distant waits
still settles settles valley
valley passes warm
