Bright sun warms the stone
Wind moves across open fields
Evening slowing down
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The night comes in slow
###
Green fields drink the rain
Fog drifts across the valley
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind moves across open fields
The night comes in slow
