sleep lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
empty night
shore lingers through storms
afternoon unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
mountains footprint stone
settles wave distant early
wind silence path wave
