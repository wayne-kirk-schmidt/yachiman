signal passes drifts
glass warm lantern shadow faint
circles holds water
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
narrow storms
bell passes through storms
sun returns
