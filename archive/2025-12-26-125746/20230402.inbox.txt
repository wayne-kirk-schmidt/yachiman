Ashes on the shore,
waves sweep them into that sea,
memories dissolve.
###
as the new day starts
shadows shorten, give way for
opportunity
###
winter meets sun
jinja (shinto temple) gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Rain moves across water still
Warm air comes to rest
###
chant chapter and verse
should we stick to ancient laws?
fulfill them anew?
