our concentration
built daily; refined, polished
fluid-like sand dunes
###
why does the dog howl?
special mournful and hopeful
speak for the unseen
###
quiet ember slow dim
empty holds empty sun slips
lingers slips dim leans
###
standing on the wall
looking from one side and on
reflected in green
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
