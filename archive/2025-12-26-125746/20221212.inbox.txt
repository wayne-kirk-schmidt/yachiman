pulsing steadily
bass notes and an underbeat
exploring new worlds
###
footsteps lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
twilight us blesses
with quiet contemplation
all this when we sleep
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
heavy windows
salt passes through windows
noon at rest
