Green fields drink the rain
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Evening slowing down
###
letters from before
composed with care and loving
freshly discovered
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
with stark white dishes
meals are eaten silence in
our repast alone
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through footsteps
pauses, time listening
