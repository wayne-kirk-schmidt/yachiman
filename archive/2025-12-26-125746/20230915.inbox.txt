summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
dim midnight
current closes through midnight
midnight at rest
###
bare settles water
settles rises leaf opens
stone circles lingers
###
mountains and rivers
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
glass lingers slides
echo slips dim shore slides
soft waits wind narrow
