summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
I wish I could see
the light that streams from your soul
as you and sleep dream
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
crossing the rivers
jumping over ponds and lakes
pure air cold and sweet
###
we do know the time
of birth through life also death
when to embrace love
