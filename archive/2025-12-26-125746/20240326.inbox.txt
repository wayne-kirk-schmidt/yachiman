closes warm leaf pale
drifts early lantern leaf bare
wind closes leans warm
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
dim birth
wood waits through jinja
birth alone
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
