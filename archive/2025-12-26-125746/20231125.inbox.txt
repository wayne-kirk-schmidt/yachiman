summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
bare morning
valley slips through morning
morning alone
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
