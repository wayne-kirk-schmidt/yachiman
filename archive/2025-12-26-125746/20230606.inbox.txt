Soft mist lifts again
Wind moves across open fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Quiet lake reflects
Wind moves across open fields
Warm air comes to rest
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hold
###
Green fields drink the rain
Heat presses down on the land
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Summer rain begins
Fog drifts across the valley
The night comes in slow
