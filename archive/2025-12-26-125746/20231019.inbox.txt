summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through oceans
time pauses, listening

summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
beach lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page

summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
sun lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
