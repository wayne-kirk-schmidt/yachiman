above the crow caw
deep in the crisp morning air
jeweled dew hanging
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
mothers now looking
past grass and flowers so green
sprouting in stone gaps
###
Warm air moves softly
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The night comes in slow
###
melismatic sounds
snake up and harmonies down
speaking to heaven
