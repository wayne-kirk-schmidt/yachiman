Warm air moves softly
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
###
dust moving around
pockets swirling quickly up
to meet the new day
###
weaving tonal webs
the best of them talk to us
with the strings they make
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
slips soft lingers pale
bare closes heavy echo
opens path snow sun
