each move to God's love
each droplet then combining
into an ocean
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows through drift deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
each station a shrine
circling the world invites
the faithful to pray
###
bracketing my words
visions of you and your heart
shaping delivery
