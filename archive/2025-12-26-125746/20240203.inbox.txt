summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
wind path shadow leaf
soft valley holds warm signal
soft drifts empty warm
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
morning and doors
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
