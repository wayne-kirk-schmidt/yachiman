summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
pale fireplace
leaf closes through moon
fireplace at rest
###
God walks winter paths
Cold hands touch running water
Winter not does speak
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Water carries old prayers
water The moves
