summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through oceans
time pauses, listening
###
lines etched in the flesh
years lovingly carving paths
of experience
###
valley leans empty
folds shadow pale folds valley
folds wind pale empty
###
do we count dishes?
washed or measure sheets folded
as the years move on?
