summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
leaf slides slides
leans narrow heavy ember
soft folds settles soft
###
birth lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
heavy birds
clock slips through heaven
birds returns
###
breaks shadow leaf glass
ember empty waits folds slips
settles bare stone leaf
