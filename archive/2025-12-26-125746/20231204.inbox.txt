shore slides wanders
passes holds path quiet signal
closes water slow
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
late spiders
ember settles through spiders
spiders unmoving
###
Forest breathes in mist
Tengu glide on mountain air
Winter wakes slow now
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
