birds and windows
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
early afternoon
wood leans through rabbits
storms alone
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
