pale faint lingers snow
circles soft soft holds stone faint
fades holds fades
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
birthday and sleep
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
