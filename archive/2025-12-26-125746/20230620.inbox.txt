Winter stone and frost
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Silence answers back
###
Winter prayer begins
Stone remembers falling snow
Faith stays unbroken
###
Stone river in frost
Water carries old prayers
Silence answers back
###
Cold stone by the stream
Prayer moves through frozen air
Silence answers back
###
Cold water on stone
Cold hands touch running water
Winter does not speak
