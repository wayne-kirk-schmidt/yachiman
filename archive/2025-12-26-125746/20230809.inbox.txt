summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
Evening meal is shared
Fire sings in orange tongues
Stars begin twice now
###
slow birth
bell fades through spring
fingerprints unmoving
###
folds ember leans ridge
leans warm closes lingers cold
empty quiet empty
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
