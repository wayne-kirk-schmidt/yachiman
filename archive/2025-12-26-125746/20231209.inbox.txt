dim doors
water slides through spring
spring returns
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
footprint drifts heavy
wave folds fades lingers drifts
empty waits heavy
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
