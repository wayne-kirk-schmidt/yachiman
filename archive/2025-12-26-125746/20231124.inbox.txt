summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
wind closes silence
still bare slides quiet empty
circles lantern slow
###
afternoon lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
pale rain
ash rises through moon
rain breathing
###
Roads shine after rain
Boulders warm under noon sun
Night listens close now
