dawn lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
footsteps lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
bare leaf valley bare
narrow pale shadow rises
breaks passes footprint
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
distant jinja
leaf leans through sleep
jinja returns
