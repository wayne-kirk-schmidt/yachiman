well starts to fill up
as I sit in the center
speaking in darkness
###
the beginning strains
reach hearts and gently whisper
of special beauty
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
hold Mountains their hush
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Nothing is kept now
###
keep close to my heart
young song and hopeful dreaming
they are part of me
