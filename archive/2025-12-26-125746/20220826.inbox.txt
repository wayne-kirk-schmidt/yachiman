looking at the hall
full of gentle loving ghosts
keeping silent watch
###
Green fields drink the rain
Heat presses down on the land
long day gentles down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hold
###
small spans of our time
outlined in seventeen steps
are the most precious
###
fish fins twitching slow
in the depths as waters flow
in sea waves which grow
