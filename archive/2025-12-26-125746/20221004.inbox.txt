tossed and flung like toys
from vengeful angels bathtubs
ships perservering
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
ferry star gazing
black whisper harbor beckons
asking you to dream
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
