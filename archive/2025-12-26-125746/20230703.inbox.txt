Cold water on stone
Water carries old prayers
Silence answers back
###
Cold prayer in winter
Cold hands touch running water
Winter does not speak
###
Stone river in frost
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Water keeps its way
###
Winter prayer begins
Water slips past silent stone
Silence answers back
###
Frozen river bends
Prayer moves through frozen air
Faith stays unbroken
