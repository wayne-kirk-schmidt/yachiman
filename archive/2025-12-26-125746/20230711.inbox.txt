still quiet closes path
path settles narrow early
wanders soft opens
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
early wave echo
fades passes slides holds
still footprint rises
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
