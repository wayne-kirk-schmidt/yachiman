summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
tissues are ripped
and knit, reripped and reknit
layered endurance
###
early heaven
bell holds through heaven
heaven breathing
###
valley soft soft faint
heavy stone ridge breaks shore slow
pale still distant moon
###
cold can curse or bless
tearing at our fragile flesh
gently or cleanse us
