completely truthful
yet all of it imagined
wonderful artwork
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
clear your vision now
calm the heart and breathe deeply
what is left to see?
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
distant stars
shore slides through fingerprints
fingerprints alone
