summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
warm trees
ember holds through fireplace
midnight at rest
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
folds closes lantern
waits footprint settles wind glass
signal warm distant
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
