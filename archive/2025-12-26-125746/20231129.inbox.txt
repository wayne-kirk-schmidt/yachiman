silence passes snow
dawn path breaks leans rises leans
shore shore pale dim quiet
###
sun lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
early midnight
glass fades through midnight
midnight breathing
###
Prayer starts in silence
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Care makes it strong now
###
summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
