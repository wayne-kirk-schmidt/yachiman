narrow dim shadow
opens water heavy wind
path narrow opens
###
dawn and morning
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
bare distant echo
heavy wind wave waits heavy
wave footprint heavy
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
Fish turn in clear stream
Roads lead past fields into dusk
Time does not stop now
