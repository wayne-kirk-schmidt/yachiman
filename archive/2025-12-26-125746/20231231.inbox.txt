summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through trees
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
Summer solstice burns
Fire sings in orange tongues
Breath turns to smoke now
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
