Summer rain begins
Light shifts over the water
Heat starts to drift off
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Light grows soft again
###
Soft mist lifts again
Heat presses down on the land
The night comes in slow
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog slithers between dark trees
Heat starts to drift off
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Light grows soft again
