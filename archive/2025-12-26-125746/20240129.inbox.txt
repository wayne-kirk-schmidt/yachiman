heavy beach
stone wanders through otera
otera returns
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
warm pale wave echo
waits leans early holds waits ridge
folds early heavy
###
Ghosts wait in hallways
Grandparents sip quiet tea
Winter steps back now
