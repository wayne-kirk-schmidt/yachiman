summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
breezes summertime
sail in and whisper coyly
of beaches and sand
###
abbot walks alone
staff jingling along the path
announcing dharma
###
Speeding along roads
white Solid unbreakable
guards as well as guides
###
slow heaven
clock lingers through heaven
heaven unmoving
