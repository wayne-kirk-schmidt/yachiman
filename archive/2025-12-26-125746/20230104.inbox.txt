Cloud shadows pass by
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Light grows soft again
###
Grandparents smile slow
Grandparents sip tea quiet
Winter steps back now
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows through drift birthday
time pauses, listening
###
Sun warms the river
River turns under old bridge
Care makes it strong now
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
