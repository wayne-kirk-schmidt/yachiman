narrow waits dim glass
glass circles wave slides leans
early lantern late
###
Flame leans into night
Rocks keep the shape of old time
Autumn lingers here
###
warm settles valley
leaf slow cold path signal ridge
footprint snow lingers
###
spring lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
