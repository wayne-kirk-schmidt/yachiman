Spring equinox dawns
Mountains cut the clouds in halves
Forest remembers
###
fall lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
circles ridge soft soft
lingers soft lingers ridge warm
settles passes snow
###
spiders lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
glass breaks warm signal
slides leaf shadow settles
fades still footprint
