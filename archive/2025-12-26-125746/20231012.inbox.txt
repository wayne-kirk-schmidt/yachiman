summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
sleep and rain
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
Summer solstice burns
Sun climbs over frost and mud
Stars begin twice now
###
slips narrow echo
narrow bare warm wind wave still
path warm echo quiet
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
