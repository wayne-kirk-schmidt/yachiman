summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
Noon rests over fields
Tengu glide on mountain air
Silence feels full now
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
