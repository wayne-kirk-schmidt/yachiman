Prayer starts in silence
A prayer rises with incense
Clouds pass below us
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
###
bare rain
ash settles through stars
rivers breathing
###
glass late cold rises
folds holds early snow settles
still slides echo
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
