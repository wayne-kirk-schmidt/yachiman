folds slips dim waits folds
soft passes lingers narrow
slow wind breaks wanders
###
early echo ridge
dim bare lantern holds ember
lingers warm slides
###
faint fog
signal rises through moon
fog at rest
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
quiet fog
leaf lingers through fog
fog breathing
