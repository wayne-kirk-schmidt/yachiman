doors and night
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
leaf wave slow drifts path
echo rises heavy still
cold empty slides
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
early doors
clock rises through windows
doors breathing
