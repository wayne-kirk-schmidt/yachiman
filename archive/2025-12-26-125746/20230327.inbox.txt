dim jinja
root leans through jinja
fog breathing
###
wet, small, and alone
seems the way that all we start
simple beginnings
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
bare morning
shore closes through morning
morning unmoving
###
what did she tell you?
that night, those day, all those years?
and did it linger?
