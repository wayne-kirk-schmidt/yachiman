late rivers
stone fades through rivers
rivers unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
slips water lingers
bare path silence distant path
shore lingers footprint
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
