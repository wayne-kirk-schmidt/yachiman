empty new years
signal passes through rabbits
rabbits returns
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
breaks footprint leaf holds
dim circles valley path still
valley folds leaf path
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through rivers
time pauses, listening
###
mountains lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
