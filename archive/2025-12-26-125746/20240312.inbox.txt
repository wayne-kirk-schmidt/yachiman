waits heavy wave path
leans drifts wind late wind silence
snow passes snow drifts
###
Sun warms the river
A prayer rises with incense
Feet choose their way now
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
