summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
faint footsteps
wind drifts through footsteps
doors alone
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
###
Ghosts wait in hallways
Trees creak like doors in the wind
Birds wake the light now
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
