summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through forests
time pauses, listening
###
empty winter
current passes through winter
winter unmoving
###
spring lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
narrow glass bare drifts
path slips dim holds water slow
waits empty ridge slow
