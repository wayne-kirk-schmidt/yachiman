Forest breathes in mist
River turns under old bridge
Night claims the house now
###
deer lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
doors lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
