God waits in silence
Water slips past silent stone
Winter does not speak
###
Stone river in frost
Water carries old prayers
Silence answers back
###
Winter water flows
God listens without reply
The water moves
###
Frozen river bends
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Faith stays unbroken
###
Cold prayer in winter
Prayer moves through frozen air
Water keeps its way
