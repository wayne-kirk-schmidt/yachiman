new years meets rabbits
moon gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
stone path leans path late
slow slow cold distant slides
late pale breaks footprint
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
soft fades lantern
shadow rises holds snow still
lingers leans silence
