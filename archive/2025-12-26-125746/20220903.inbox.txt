summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening

summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
what comes first to us?
try and fail? try and succeed?
we build from them both
###
Winter solstice comes
Tengu glide on mountain air
Autumn lingers here
###
one point a on line
assures others of the whole
counting continues
