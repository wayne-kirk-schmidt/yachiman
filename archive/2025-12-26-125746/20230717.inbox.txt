summer breathes softly
birds shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
warm sleep
salt rises through sleep
trees at rest
###
valley wanders leaf
slips heavy wanders silence
passes dim faint wave
###
bare fireplace
ash leans through fireplace
fireplace at rest
###
otera (buddhist temple) lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
