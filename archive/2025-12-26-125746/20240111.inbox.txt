summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
shore opens drifts ridge
ridge snow footprint lingers quiet
heavy silence night
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
