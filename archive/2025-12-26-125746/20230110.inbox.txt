routines and patterns
can be cages or roadways
understand them well
###
late ember shadow
footprint wind drifts glass heavy
echo folds early
###
cling to hope and light
work to make the world better
people remember
###
if faced with nothing
what would you do? then recant?
no. faith sees beyond.
###
move the watch ahead
measuring seconds minutes
fulfilling the days
