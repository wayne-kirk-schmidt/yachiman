Green fields drink the rain
Fog slithers between dark trees
Heat starts to drift off
###
Soft mist lifts again
Fog drifts across the valley
Day slips into rest
###
Hot pavement steams now
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm air comes to rest
###
Green fields drink the rain
Rain moves across still water
The night comes in slow
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Day slips into rest
