summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
waits ridge faint early
passes drifts empty wave wave
still ridge warm lingers
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
dim oceans
current breaks through summer
summer alone
