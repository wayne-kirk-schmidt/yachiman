Roads shine after rain
warm Boulders under noon sun
Night listens close now
###
cold forests
leaf folds through forests
forests rest at
###
reluctant fog
passes ice through the grey mist
swirling and restless
###
stone opens night dim
warm soft breaks holds path lantern
breaks bare lingers cold
###
not far from the flame
moths dance and sing happily
knowing what awaits
