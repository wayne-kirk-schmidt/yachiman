morning dew clings tight
to each blade of newborn grass
in diamonds sunlight
###
paper lanterns rise
yet the moon outshines them all
one flame stars among
###
as the bassline arcs
downwards deep into our ears
mimicking heartbeats
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
night lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
