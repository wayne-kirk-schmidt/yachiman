Cloud shadows pass by
Wind moves across open fields
The heat loosens grip
###
Summer rain begins
Fog drifts across the valley
Heat starts to drift off
###
Hot pavement steams now
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The night comes in slow
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Fog slithers between dark trees
Evening slowing down
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Fog slithers between dark trees
Time eases its hold
