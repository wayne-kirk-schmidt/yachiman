enshrined notation
expressing joy and sadness
theorems dancing
###
breathes summer softly
oceans shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
mist and birds
two currents cross within stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
footstep echoing
dusty imprints racing up
dimly lit staircases
###
narrow afternoon
breath breaks through afternoon
afternoon alone
