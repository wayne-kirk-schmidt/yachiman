Hot pavement steams now
Rain moves across still water
Heat starts to drift off
###
Hot pavement steams now
Mist drifts along quiet roads
The night comes in slow
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Light shifts over the water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Hot pavement steams now
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
Quiet lake reflects
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
