Summer rain begins
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Light grows soft again
###
Quiet lake reflects
Light shifts over the water
Time eases its hold
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain moves across still water
Evening slowing down
###
Warm air moves softly
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
