slow heaven
clock lingers through heaven
heaven unmoving
###
warm birthday
current folds through birthday
birthday alone
###
birds lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
opens path valley
lantern drifts dim empty leaf
signal wave slips ridge
###
new years and noon
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
