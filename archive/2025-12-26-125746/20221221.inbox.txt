reading nourishes
to learn and explore new worlds
with your mind as guide
###
empires wax and wane
small beacons of light blazing
for a few scant days
###
What did we see there
in between the memories
age reliving love
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through oceans
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
