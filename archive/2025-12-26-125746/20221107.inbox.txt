Bright sun warms the stone
Wind moves across open fields
The heat loosens grip
###
new borders seeded
planted by fears and worries
that bear twisted fruit
###
analysis strives
teasing apart the results
makes hypotheses
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
early path holds pale
narrow lingers opens bare
soft rises echo
