night lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
Birds rise at sunrise
Boulders warm under noon sun
Water keeps pace now
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
mountains lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
faint mountains
signal breaks through mountains
mountains unmoving
