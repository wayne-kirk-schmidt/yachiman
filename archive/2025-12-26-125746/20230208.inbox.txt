so that I will know
saying secret words daily
building memory
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
early echo ridge
dim bare lantern holds ember
lingers warm slides
###
at the very end
of the bay a silver ring
gleams at that bottom
