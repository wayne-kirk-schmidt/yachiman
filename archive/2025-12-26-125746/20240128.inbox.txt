summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
shadow fall settles
dim circles shadow bare leans
signal folds fall cold
###
early footsteps
glass breaks through footsteps
footsteps unmoving
###
path wind circles pale
passes snow heavy morning
dim slides slow wave
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
