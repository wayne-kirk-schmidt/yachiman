Summer rain begins
Wind bending tall summer grass
Light grows soft again
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Wind bending tall summer grass
The long day slows down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind bending tall summer grass
Time eases its hold
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog slithers between dark trees
The night comes in slow
###
Soft mist lifts again
Light shifts over the water
The long day slows down
