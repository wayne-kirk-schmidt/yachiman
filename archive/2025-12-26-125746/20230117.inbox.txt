inventing the world
one truth told at a time
a good way to go
###
pushing the passion
the into hot crucible
to build something more
###
motion in flowers
pollen floating and moving
golden yellow snow
###
oceans and forests
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
faint night
bell closes through night
night unmoving
