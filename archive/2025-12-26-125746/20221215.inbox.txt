working through sorrow
is not hard you when forget
the cause of the ache
###
rabbits lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns that page
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain moves across still water
The heat loosens grip
###
Ptolemy told us
stressing each spoken sentence
quiet gentle truths
###
Shadows chase the sun,
the hurried clouds drift apart,
sky clears for that dawn.
