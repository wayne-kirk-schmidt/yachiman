into their eyes we look
and see hope and love and joy
strong family bonds
###
shells within my hands crack
with old age in the water
feeding sands anew
###
the enlightenment
of a monk or president
all stem from stillness
###
closes early warm
quiet lantern ridge snow slips faint
soft stone opens bare
###
empty birth
ember rises through birth
birth unmoving
