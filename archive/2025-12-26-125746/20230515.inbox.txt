Warm wind bends the grass
Wind bending tall summer grass
Light grows soft again
###
Green fields drink the rain
Fog drifts across the valley
The heat loosens grip

Green fields drink the rain
Wind bending tall summer grass
Light grows soft again
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Light shifts over the water
Evening slowing down
###
Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
The heat loosens grip
