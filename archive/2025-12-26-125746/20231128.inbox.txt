summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
bare early still wave
wanders narrow passes warm
ridge wanders cold soft
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
