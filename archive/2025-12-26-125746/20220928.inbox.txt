night Winter so long,
stars hurry behind the clouds,
moonlight fades too soon.
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
Heaven feels so near
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Footprints fade out now
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
"That cannot be drawn!"
artists gesture and exclaim
a face of true void
