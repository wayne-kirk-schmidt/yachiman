summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
lantern holds water
soft path slips faint distant cold
path lantern passes
###
breaks opens lingers
slow footprint settles footprint
glass stone pale closes
###
otera (buddhist temple) and fireplace
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
deer lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
