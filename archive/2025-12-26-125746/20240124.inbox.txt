breaks lingers passes
snow shore warm silence holds leans
signal silence stone
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
Grandparents smile slow
Grandparents sip quiet tea
Winter steps back now
###
summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
