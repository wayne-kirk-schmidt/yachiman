River flows softly,
Surging waves splash on warm rocks,
Summer breathes in peace.
###
soft spring
shore folds through spring
spring unmoving
###
glass echo rabbits
ember leaf shore leaf circles
signal holds holds slow
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through storms
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
