Enoch spreads his arms
and walks that ground carefully
attended by hosts
###
glinting in the sun
metal expresses beauty
reserved for weapons
###
fades circles leans
cold leaf slips path birds slips leans
footprint folds lantern
###
fades late soft leaf
shore shore soft heavy slow path
closes early slips
###
bare footsteps
signal folds through footsteps
footsteps breathing
