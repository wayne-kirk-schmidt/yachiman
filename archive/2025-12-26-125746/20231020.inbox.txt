summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
stone opens night dim
warm soft breaks holds path lantern
breaks bare lingers cold
###
Night sea breathes slowly
Moon hangs above sleeping roofs
Inside feels warm now
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through fall
time pauses, listening
