summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
before we began
first at was there a purpose?
my faith tells me yes
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
footsteps lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
