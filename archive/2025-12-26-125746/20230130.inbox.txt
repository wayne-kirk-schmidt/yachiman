eyes that look at age
see the steps, paths, and choices
listening to tales
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through birthday
time listening pauses,
###
shadows are imprints
photographs made out of dark
after images
###
presenting myself
gaze from mirror to mirror
the within hallway
###
resting on my arm
my grandchild I know and love
breathing quite gently
