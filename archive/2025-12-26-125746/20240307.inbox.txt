stars meets windows
night gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
path holds snow narrow
lingers drifts circles quiet soft
narrow slow wave dim
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
drifts waits shadow faint
soft slips narrow ridge rises
wanders shore wanders
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
