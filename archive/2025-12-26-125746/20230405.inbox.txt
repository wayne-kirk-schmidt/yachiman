signal slow silence
leans snow leans water lantern
footprint heavy path
###
expiration of doubt
maturing into knowledge
with belief's waters
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
falling from heaven
white blue and and grey and green
spring weather colors
###
divisions in clay
shaped and smoothed guided with love
to build the vessel
