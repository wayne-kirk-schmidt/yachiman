leaf fades dim leaf
narrow early drifts pale leans
wave lantern dim stone
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
pale passes opens
water bare late slips slips path
bare valley dim warm
