River flows softly,
Surging waves splash on warm rocks,
Summer breathes in peace.
###
bath water steaming
calming soothing at days end
islands of comfort
###
lordship of the trees
living life full of purpose
to defiant the world
###
summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
otera (buddhist temple) and footsteps
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
