summer breathes softly
fireplace shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
wind quiet holds lantern
path circles drifts settles path
fades rises wave
###
Night sea breathes slowly
Boulders warm under noon sun
Time does not stop now
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through mountains
time pauses, listening
###
cold doors
bell breaks through doors
doors unmoving
