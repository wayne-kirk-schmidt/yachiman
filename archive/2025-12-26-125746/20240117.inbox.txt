summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through mountains
time pauses, listening
###
fog meets fall
spring gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
late glass narrow pale
path slips faint wave leaf slides
still drifts waits shore glass
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
