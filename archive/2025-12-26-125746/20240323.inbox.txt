summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
birth lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
empty fireplace
silence settles through fingerprints
fireplace at rest
###
rises fades snow
ember waits warm drifts faint stone
shadow opens dim
###
still echo footprint
glass lingers wave faint lingers
slow rises early
