heavy night
ash holds through footsteps
night alone
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
rivers and fingerprints
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
slips fades distant
holds ember shore soft rises
faint soft shore cold leans
