summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
holds wave glass water
lingers wind spiders slips wind
folds stone bare early
###
morning lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
breaks leaf bare snow holds
fingerprints late leaf lantern
warm slides leans waits
###
birds lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
