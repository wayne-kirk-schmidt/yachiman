summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through fall
time pauses, listening
###
winter meets sun
jinja (shinto temple) gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
