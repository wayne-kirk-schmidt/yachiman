shore snow folds footprint
passes late narrow fades
water closes slips
###
bare trees
wood passes through fireplace
fireplace unmoving
###
fades breaks circles
fades lingers circles breaks
shore early path ridge
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
bare doors
water rises through doors
doors returns
