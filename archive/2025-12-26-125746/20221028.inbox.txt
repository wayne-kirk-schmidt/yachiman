when we face the breeze
fresh smells and sharp sounds coming
straightway from our past
###
heavy valley warm
fades footprint still narrow
lantern stone footprint
###
we would know ourselves?
when we move past or behind?
what could we tell us?
###
no we did not see
the start of the cometfall
we felt that impact
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows through drift doors
time pauses, listening
