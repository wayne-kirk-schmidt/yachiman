Cold prayer in winter
God listens without reply
The water moves
###
Winter water flows
Prayer moves through frozen air
The water moves
###
Cold prayer in winter
God listens without reply
The water moves
###
God waits in silence
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Winter does not speak
###
Prayer rises in cold
God listens without reply
The water moves
