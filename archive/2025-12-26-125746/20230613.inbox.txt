Thin fog drifts at dawn
Rain moves across still water
Warm air comes to rest
###
Green fields drink the rain
Light shifts over the water
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Hot pavement steams now
Wind moves across open fields
Evening slowing down
###
Warm wind bends the grass
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
###
Warm air moves softly
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Evening slowing down
