hurtling through the night
to a morning stop away
running to arrive
###
chill winds throughout March
small gusts playfully tease out
lasts gasps of winter
###
Annabelle the ant
sweeps the dust in small patterns
observes and dharma
###
summer breathes softly
forests drift shadows through trees
time pauses, listening
###
where were you in time?
when the beginning began?
when the end was done?
