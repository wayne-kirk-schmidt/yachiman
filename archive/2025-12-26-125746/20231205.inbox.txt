jinja (shinto temple) lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
drifts lantern footprint
faint bare rises wanders folds
leans warm bare lingers
###
birthday meets storms
forests gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
shore opens quiet folds
glass ridge slips opens shore slips
valley snow cold breaks
###
pale warm breaks slides
ridge breaks passes mist footprint
snow wind soft early
