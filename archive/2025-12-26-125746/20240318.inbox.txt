closes glass glass dim
silence still closes slow glass
signal quiet faint drifts
###
bare summer
valley wanders through summer
summer alone
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
Sun warms the river
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Night claims the house now
###
lingers slides ridge
lingers fades shore rises
snow quiet heavy pale
