summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
###
birthday lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
soft dawn
clock slides through dawn
dawn unmoving
###
waits drifts narrow quiet
wave leaf waits faint holds heavy
rises fades waits
###
wind valley dim folds
closes still rises settles
dim shore sun empty
