Winter prayer starts
Gray clouds press on still rivers
The water moves
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Cold hands touch running water
The water moves
###
Cold water on stone
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Winter does not speak
###
Stone river in frost
Water carries old prayers
Silence answers back
###
Stone river in frost
Gray clouds press on still rivers
Water keeps its way
