summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
note the location
it will change and we will change
therein lies beauty
###
creeping slowly down
green furry inchworm delights
hanging from fine leaves
###
we put things to rest
and walk on in the jungles
allowing them to grow
###
push people to be
to look to act to feel more
to become better
