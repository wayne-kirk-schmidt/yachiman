summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
quiet valley still glass
lingers ridge faint narrow shore
still waits silence leaf
###
rabbits and fall
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
spiders lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
