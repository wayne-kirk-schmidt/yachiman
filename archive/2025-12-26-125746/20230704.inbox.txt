Cold prayer in winter
Cold hands touch running water
Water keeps its way
###
Cold water on stone
Water carries old prayers
Winter does not speak
###
Cold stone by the stream
Water slips past silent stone
Stillness endures
###
Cold water on stone
Prayer moves through frozen air
Stillness endures
###
God walks winter paths
Water carries old prayers
Winter does not speak
