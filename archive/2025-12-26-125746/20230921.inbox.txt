summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
narrow summer
light folds through summer
summer alone
###
birds lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
morning lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
early cold holds holds
slow leaf slides faint folds slips
distant shore wave wave
