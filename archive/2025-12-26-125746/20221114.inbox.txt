heavy night
ash holds through footsteps
night alone
###
tunneling through grief
we see the light at the end
we when live one more
###
from depths the hidden
from tidal pools and beyond
new life rejoices
###
footprint opens glass
wind slow dim ember sleep waits
distant warm empty
###
monk, the sitting down,
reads the scriptures and writes songs
brown with white and black
