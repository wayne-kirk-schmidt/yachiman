summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through deer
pauses, time listening
###
Cold water on stone
Prayer moves through frozen air
Stillness endures
###
pain creeps by edges
teasing me with the small aches
fresh accomplishments
###
trees and jinja (shinto temple)
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
rivers lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
