Green fields drink the rain
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The heat loosens grip
###
Green fields drink the rain
Light shifts over the water
The night comes in slow
###
Hot pavement steams now
Wind moves across open fields
Evening slowing down
