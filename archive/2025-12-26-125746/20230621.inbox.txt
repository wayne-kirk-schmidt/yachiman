Winter water flows
Water carries old prayers
Silence answers back
###
Prayer rises in cold
Gray clouds press on still rivers
The water moves
###
Winter stone and frost
Stone remembers falling snow
Water keeps its way
###
Cold stone by the stream
Prayer moves through frozen air
Faith stays unbroken
###
Gray stone holds the cold
Water slips past silent stone
Stillness endures
