Quiet lake reflects
Fog slithers between dark trees
Time eases its hold
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog drifts across the valley
The night comes in slow
###
Green fields drink the rain
Rain carving lines in warm dust
Heat starts to drift off
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Fog drifts across the valley
The night comes in slow
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Heat presses down on the land
The long day slows down
