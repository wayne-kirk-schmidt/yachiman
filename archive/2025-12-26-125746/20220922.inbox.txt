we ate the apple
enjoying first bite to last
unaware of time
###
hatchling the breaks shell
sunlight pours into small eyes
sky becomes a home
###
early midnight
glass fades through midnight
midnight breathing
###
but if I did say
"peace. be well you with also."
would it still suffice?
###
asking our questions
of others and of ourselves
seeking new answers
