slips narrow echo
narrow bare warm wind wave still
path warm echo quiet
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
walking down the stairs
we stumble and fall and then
only to rise up
###
distant sun
clock leans through sun
sun alone
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
