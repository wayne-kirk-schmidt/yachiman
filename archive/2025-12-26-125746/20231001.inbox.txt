fog lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
passes ridge settles
closes dim silence soft still
leaf fall ridge holds leans
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
