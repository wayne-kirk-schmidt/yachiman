summer breathes softly
windows shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
Spring equinox dawns
Waves comb the shore, then retreat
Boots slow their pace now
###
soft windows
glass breaks through spring
windows alone
###
still path rises soft
shore glass wind path ridge valley
still opens valley
