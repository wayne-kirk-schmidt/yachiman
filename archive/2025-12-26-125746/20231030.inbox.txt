summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
fireplace meets heaven
spiders gathers at the threshold
silence holds its shape
###
bare opens lantern
closes stone ember lantern
waits quiet glass warm bare
