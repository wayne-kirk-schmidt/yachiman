Bright sun warms the stone
Fog slithers between dark trees
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The night comes in slow
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm air comes to rest
###
Quiet lake reflects
Wind bending tall summer grass
The long day slows down
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Wind moves across open fields
The long day slows down
