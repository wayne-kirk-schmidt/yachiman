empty birth
ember rises through birth
birth unmoving
###
new years lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
late birth
salt lingers through heaven
heaven unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
footprint drifts early
glass glass wind snow lingers quiet
ridge stone breaks wanders
