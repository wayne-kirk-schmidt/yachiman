summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
softly timid steps
step into that bright presence
to speak for us all
###
River flows gently,
Surging rocks past with a splash,
Summer sun warms all,
###
early path holds pale
narrow lingers opens bare
soft rises echo
###
soft rabbits
snow leans through mountains
breathing morning
