dim spiders
shadow settles through spiders
fireplace at rest
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
on the sound structure
made within turmoil baked in stress
also glazed in peace
###
early birds
snow opens through birds
birds returns
###
Quiet lake reflects
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
