summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
cold wanders shadow
bare leans quiet rises wind pale
signal wave wave snow
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
River flows softly,
Surging waves splash on the rocks,
Summer light glistens.
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
