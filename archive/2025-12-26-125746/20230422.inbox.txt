Warm air moves softly
Rain moves across still water
Light grows soft again
###
Warm air moves softly
Heat presses down on the land
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Hot pavement steams now
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The night comes in slow
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Fog drifts across the valley
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Quiet lake reflects
Heat presses down on the land
Evening slowing down
