frogs sit in their ponds
enjoying standing water
dreaming of fat flies
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
early footstep
glass breaks through footsteps
footsteps unmoving
###
Your dreams start with love
adding in desires and hopes
garnishing with joy
