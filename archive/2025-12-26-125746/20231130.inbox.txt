trees shadow distant
lingers footprint path wanders
drifts glass folds heavy
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
###
warm lingers slow faint
empty waits circles slides
soft valley early
###
fog lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
