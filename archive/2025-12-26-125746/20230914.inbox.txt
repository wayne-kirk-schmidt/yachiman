summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
early breaks lingers
pale late fades empty wind
footprint still slips waits
###
otera (buddhist temple) lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
slow winter
valley opens through winter
summer alone
###
fog and moon
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
