summer softly breathes
birds shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
Autumn leaves scatter,
the wind hurries them away,
none return again.
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
Green fields drink the rain
Fog slithers between dark trees
Day slips into rest
