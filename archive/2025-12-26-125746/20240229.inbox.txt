summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
lingers late closes
closes glass glass leaf wind cold
early holds shadow
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through rain
time pauses, listening
###
dim fall
glass slips through fingerprints
fall unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
