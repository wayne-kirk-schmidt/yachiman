summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
Midnight holds its breath
Children chase light on wet roads
Lungs fill with light now
###
Forest breathes in mist
Heaven opens in small joys
Home settles in now
###
winter lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
