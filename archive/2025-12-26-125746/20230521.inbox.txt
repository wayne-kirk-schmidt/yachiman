Bright sun warms the stone
Heat presses down on the land
Warm air comes to rest
###
Hot pavement steams now
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Warm air comes to rest
###
Soft mist lifts again
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The heat loosens grip
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Cloud shadows pass across fields
Heat starts to drift off
