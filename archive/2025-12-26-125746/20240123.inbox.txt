summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
water slides waits
faint empty settles cold breaks
slow signal slow glass
###
early birds
glass fades through birds
birds returns
