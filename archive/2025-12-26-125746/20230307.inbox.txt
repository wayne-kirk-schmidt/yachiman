bare morning
shore closes through morning
morning unmoving
###
I mention to you
the passages and chapters
to help us both then
###
Evening meal is shared
Counting hours haste without
Footprints fade out now
###
mountain paths alive
with the sound of trickling streams
water’s quiet hymn
###
dim mountains
breath folds through mountains
fingerprints at rest
