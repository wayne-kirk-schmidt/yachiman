shore slow holds holds still
opens soft glass lantern glass
stone pale path water
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through new years
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
fall shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
