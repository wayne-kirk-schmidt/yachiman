Green fields drink the rain
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Evening slowing down
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The heat loosens grip
###
Soft mist lifts again
Light shifts over the water
The long day slows down
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Light grows soft again
###
Quiet lake reflects
Light shifts over the water
Day slips into rest
