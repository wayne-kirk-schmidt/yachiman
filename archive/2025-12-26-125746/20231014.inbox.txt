faint winter
stone drifts through winter
winter alone
###
midnight lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
lantern drifts water
rain shore slides faint early
settles dim ridge still
###
moon and windows
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
