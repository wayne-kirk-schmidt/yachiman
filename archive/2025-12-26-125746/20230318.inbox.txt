summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through fingerprints
pauses, time listening
###
Midnight holds its breath
Children chase light upon wet roads
Lungs fill with light now
###
of blessings the moon
outline roads envelope houses
for just a few hours
###
looking for small glass,
that, when combined, can become
beautiful murals
###
step along water
within skipping high bright arcs
twirling in the sun
