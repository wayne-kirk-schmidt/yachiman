special rules apply
when matters of heart the ask
for our forgiveness
###
farmer’s hat pulled low
against the stubborn brightness
sweat salts the furrows
###
A letter to God
best written to a penpal
regularly sent
###
summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
###
still red and orange
leaking sbrightly sweet juices
fruits in the morning
