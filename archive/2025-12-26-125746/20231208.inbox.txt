summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
empty early shore
dim drifts shadow closes folds
breaks fades slips faint
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
pale midnight
root slides through midnight
midnight breathing
###
Autumn leaves drift down
Rocks keep the shape of old time
Rain comes again now
