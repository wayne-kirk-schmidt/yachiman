summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
late storms
leaf passes through storms
midnight unmoving
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
ember slides faint
path fades snow dim slips drifts
passes cold narrow
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through oceans
time pauses, listening
