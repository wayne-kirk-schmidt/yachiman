summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
start rituals when
actions are no longer seen
as explainable
###
all things eat to live
yet do we where consider
the meals started from?
###
late rain
water settles through rain
fingerprints returns
###
in the moon center,
it dark, is lonely, and cold
outside shining bright
