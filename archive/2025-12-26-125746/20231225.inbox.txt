narrow quiet lingers
fades still wave folds passes
path valley footprint
###
quiet noon
path fades through noon
noon returns
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
leans lantern breaks warm
signal leaf fades leans still
lantern slow empty
