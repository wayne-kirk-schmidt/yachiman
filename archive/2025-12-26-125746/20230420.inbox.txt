Warm wind bends the grass
Light shifts over the water
Time eases its hold
###
Summer rain begins
Fog drifts across the valley
The long day slows down
###
Hot pavement steams now
Rain moves across still water
Evening slowing down
###
Warm air moves softly
Rain moves across still water
Warm air comes to rest
###
Cloud shadows pass by
Wind moves across open fields
Evening slowing down
