bare new years
wave closes through oceans
jinja at rest
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through heaven
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
Night sea breathes slowly
Thread binds torn cloth back to whole
Shadows grow tall now
###
Evening meal is shared
Counting hours without haste
Footprints fade out now
