summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
bare early pale wind
settles passes ridge lantern
path slow slow heavy
###
stars lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
windows lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through noon
time pauses, listening
