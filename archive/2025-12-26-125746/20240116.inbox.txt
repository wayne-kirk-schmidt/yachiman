summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
quiet fog
ember opens through fog
fog at rest
###
Autumn leaves drift down
A prayer rises with incense
Lizards lie still now
###
spiders and doors
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
