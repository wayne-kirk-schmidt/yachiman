pale slow wave slides
slips wind echo wind glass drifts
water quiet slips dim
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
Winter solstice comes
Tengu glide on mountain air
Autumn lingers here
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
