summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
supporting vision
dark and light behind each door
heavenly signposts
###
spring moon on the lake
shivering with silver light
touches every wave
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through storms
time listening pauses,
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
