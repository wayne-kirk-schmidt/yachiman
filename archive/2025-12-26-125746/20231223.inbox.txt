summer breathes softly
fog shadows drift through birds
time pauses, listening
###
passes snow glass ridge
closes slides ember glass
holds quiet wanders breaks
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
Baby breath is calm
Ice holds the world for a breath
Mind clears at once now
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
