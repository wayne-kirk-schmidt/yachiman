summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
noon drift shadows through moon
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through fog
time pauses, listening
###
watch a bird flying
right through the open window
purpose pursuing
###
Soft mist lifts again
Rain carving lines within warm dust
Warm air comes to rest
