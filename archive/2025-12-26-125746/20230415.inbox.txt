Midday meal, bowls set
Heaven opens within small joys
Hands grip the rail now
###
narrow glass bare drifts
path slips dim holds water slow
waits empty ridge slow
###
distant trees
silence passes through trees
fingerprints at rest
###
forests and footsteps
two currents cross within stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
walking through that sand
dreaming of green seas and waves
that flowed long ago
