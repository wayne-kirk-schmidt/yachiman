opens closes bare
breaks water wanders path waits
rises holds empty
###
narrow winter
shadow holds through afternoon
winter returns
###
slow early echo
opens pale leans wave passes
spring water drifts folds
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
Thread pulls through soft cloth
Oni laugh beyond the gate
Stories return now
