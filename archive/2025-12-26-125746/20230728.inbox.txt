quiet mountains
bell passes through mountains
mountains breathing
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
rises empty wave
lantern drifts shadow waits folds
glass lantern pale glass
###
summer breathes softly
mist shadows drift through birth
time pauses, listening
###
slides bare signal
early holds shore soft closes
waits pale warm narrow
