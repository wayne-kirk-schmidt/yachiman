Warm wind bends the grass
Wind bending tall summer grass
Day slips into rest
###
Hot pavement steams now
Wind bending tall summer grass
Day slips into rest
###
Soft mist lifts again
Fog slithers between dark trees
Shadows stretch at dusk
###
Warm air moves softly
Fog slithers between dark trees
The long day slows down
###
Soft mist lifts again
Wind bending tall summer grass
Warm air comes to rest
