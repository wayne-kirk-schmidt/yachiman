Turning my gaze too late
Glimpsing the sad frail motions
I must respond now
###
warm sun
thread folds through sun
midnight unmoving
###
campfire on the ridge
its smoke joins the Milky Way
whispers into night
###
stepping into light
we see afterimages
of who we once were
###
Warm air softly moves
Wind bending tall summer grass
Shadows stretch at dusk
