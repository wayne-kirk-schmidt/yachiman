summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
waits drifts fades wind
ridge breaks wave faint signal path
narrow footprint slips
###
storms and heaven
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
holds ridge distant waits
still settles settles valley
valley passes warm
###
heavy spring
glass drifts through spring
spring breathing
