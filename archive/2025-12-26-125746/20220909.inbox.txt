hewn from white granite
proudly guarding our welfare
always come in twos
###
can we finish this?
the sentence and paragraph?
do not hesitate
###
bright definitions
colors, sounds, and sensations
swirl all around us
###
from a great ruler
building the generations
yet dust has claimed them
###
could you be in love?
consumed by flames of passion?
only time will tell
