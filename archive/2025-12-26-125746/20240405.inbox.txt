summer breathes softly
night shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
###
circles leans folds faint
lingers wave waits silence bare
folds wind leans passes
###
Noon rests over fields
Moon hangs above sleeping roofs
Care makes it strong now
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
