Cloud shadows pass by
Fog drifts across the valley
The heat loosens grip
###
Soft mist lifts again
Cloud shadows pass across fields
The heat loosens grip
###
Quiet lake reflects
Wind moves across open fields
Warm air comes to rest
###
Warm air moves softly
Mist drifts along quiet roads
Day slips into rest
###
Summer rain begins
Rain moves across still water
Day slips into rest
