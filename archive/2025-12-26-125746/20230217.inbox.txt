summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through heaven
time listening pauses,
###
logic and reason
then merged with humility
can complement faith
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through years new
time pauses, listening
###
as the smallest mouse
moves with curiosity
and tiny beauty
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
