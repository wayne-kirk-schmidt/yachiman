Summer rain begins
Fog drifts across the valley
Time eases its hold
###
Thin fog drifts at dawn
Heat presses down on the land
Day slips into rest
###
Summer rain begins
Wind bending tall summer grass
Day slips into rest
###
Hot pavement steams now
Rain moves across still water
The night comes in slow
###
Warm air moves softly
Rain moves across still water
The night comes in slow
