shooting star falls quick
writing brief its fiery note
vanishing in dark
###
my face shows a tear
only shed after talking
and she walks away
###
summer breathes softly
mountains shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
regard altarpieces
seeing the truth instead of
dim lit memories
