A lantern sways low,
painting circles in that dark,
moths drift to its flame.
###
holds warm heavy snow
shore quiet early distant holds
slips path drifts hancients slow
###
raindrops kiss the soil
seed uncoils in trembling earth
roots taste life at last
###
how to deal with pain?
cry and moan, laugh also pray
yet sleep works the best
###
diaries explain
about us every day
what we tell others
