summer breathes softly
doors shadows drift through sleep
time listening pauses,
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through otera
time pauses, listening
###
Summer rain begins
Wind moves across open fields
Day slips into rest
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
###
gathering clouds fall
speeding to the earth grimly
storms gather to dance
