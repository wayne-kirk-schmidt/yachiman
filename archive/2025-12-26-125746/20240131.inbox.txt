summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through sun
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
spring shadows drift through trees
time pauses, listening
###
distant oceans
valley drifts through oceans
heaven breathing
###
fall lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through beach
time pauses, listening
