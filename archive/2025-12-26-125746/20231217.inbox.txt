summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through windows
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
winter shadows drift through night
time pauses, listening
###
cold otera
glass wanders through otera
otera at rest
###
summer breathes softly
spiders shadows drift through moon
time pauses, listening
###
Waves lean on the shore
Rain drums on roof and window
Time leans forward now
