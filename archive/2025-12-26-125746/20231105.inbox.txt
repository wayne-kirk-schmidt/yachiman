valley breaks dim holds
dim wave breaks narrow lingers
distant wanders quiet
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through sleep
time pauses, listening
###
leaf heavy bare wave
opens bare leans lingers glass
signal footprint late
###
heavy jinja
stone breaks through jinja
jinja returns
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through fireplace
time pauses, listening
