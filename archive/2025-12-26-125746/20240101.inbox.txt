distant morning
stone waits through spring
morning breathing
###
slides wanders folds
dim footprint glass snow rises
lingers holds cold dim
###
summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through spiders
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rain shadows drift through footsteps
time pauses, listening
###
shadow still pale stone
stone ridge leaf quiet heavy warm
valley pale shadow
