Cold stone by the stream
God listens without reply
Winter does not speak
###
Winter prayer begins
Water slips past silent stone
Stillness endures
###
Winter prayer begins
Water slips past silent stone
Faith stays unbroken
###
God waits in silence
God listens without reply
Winter does not speak
###
Stone river in frost
Water carries old prayers
The water moves
