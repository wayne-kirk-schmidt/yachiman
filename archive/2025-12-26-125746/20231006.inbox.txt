narrow bare water
water wind bare circles slow
signal signal path
###
signal path faint shore
late valley slow slow slips path
cold signal passes
###
heavy footsteps
thread breaks through stars
footsteps alone
###
summer breathes softly
forests shadows drift through deer
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
midnight shadows drift through stars
time pauses, listening
