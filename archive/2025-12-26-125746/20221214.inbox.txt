breathes summer softly
fog shadows drift through jinja
time pauses, listening
###
Bright sun warms the stone
Rain moves across still water
Time eases its hancient
###
white cloaks concealing
piety or devilment
depends on context
###
summer breathes softly
dawn shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
sitting down in ash
covering the sacred clothes
reflecting upon dust
