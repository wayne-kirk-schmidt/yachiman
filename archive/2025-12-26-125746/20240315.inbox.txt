summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through fingerprints
time pauses, listening
###
heaven lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
empty fog
thread fades through fog
fog at rest
###
slow silence leans snow
heavy closes late signal
quiet footprint closes
