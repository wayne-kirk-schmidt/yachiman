faint distant settles
snow holds opens ridge signal
pale slow leaf opens
###
summer breathes softly
morning shadows drift through rabbits
time pauses, listening
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through afternoon
time pauses, listening
###
dim winter
clock leans through footsteps
footsteps alone
###
summer breathes softly
rivers shadows drift through birthday
time pauses, listening
