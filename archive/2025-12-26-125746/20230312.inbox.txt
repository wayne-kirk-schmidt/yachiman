folded crisply white
gleaming so brilliantly
clothes as well as shrouds
###
down digging deeply
search for food and meaning
roots entwine and grow
###
quickly the heart heals
forgetting the agony
letting ache subside
###
I cannot tell you
if the reaches of the sea
starts or ends with tears
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through mist
time pauses, listening
