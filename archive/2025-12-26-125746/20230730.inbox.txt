summer breathes softly
oceans shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
###
slow dawn
light drifts through dawn
dawn breathing
###
fall and new years
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
storms lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
summer breathes softly
storms shadows drift through morning
time pauses, listening
