summer breathes softly
beach shadows drift through dawn
time pauses, listening
###
fades wave lantern
heavy empty dim cold wave
folds quiet ember stone
###
mist and dawn
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
###
late rain
water settles through rain
fingerprints returns
###
rain and stars
two currents cross in stillness
time listens, unmoved
