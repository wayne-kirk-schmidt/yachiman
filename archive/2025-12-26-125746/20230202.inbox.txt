four thousand weeks pass
with purpose and quiet grace
life celebrating
###
leans signal pale bare
wanders settles narrow breaks
leaf ember still ridge
###
fall slow
iron circles through sun
fall unmoving
###
make the heart in parts
grown neither fitted nor smoothed
but still beautiful
###
relaxing at night
numbers dancing in my head
old friends to help sleep
