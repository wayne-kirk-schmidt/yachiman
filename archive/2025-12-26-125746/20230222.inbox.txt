faint mountains
wave leans through mountains
new year returns
###
dim slow settles mist
circles ridge rises leans soft
settles ember slips
###
Winter stone and frost
Prayer moves through frozen air
Winter does not speak
###
not without some pain
but with the best intentions
striving and living
###
within the second
footprint melting the first snow
following the first
