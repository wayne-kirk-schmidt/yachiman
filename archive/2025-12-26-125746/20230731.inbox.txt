quiet drifts warm stone breaks
lantern slides ember bare
slow warm shore lantern
###
warm morning
shadow settles through morning
heaven returns
###
beach lingers
quiet breath in borrowed light
sleep turns the page
###
settles drifts valley
leaf lingers settles water
slips signal early
###
summer breathes softly
afternoon shadows drift through doors
time pauses, listening
