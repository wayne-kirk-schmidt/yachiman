summer breathes softly
trees shadows drift through midnight
time pauses, listening
###
Quiet lake reflects
Rain carving lines in warm dust
The long day slows down
###
within our own flesh
structures of bone and muscle
cooperating.
###
when done before next
for the briefest of seconds
we know a stillness
###
flowering yellow
hopeful, tentative, and young
breaks through the wet loam
