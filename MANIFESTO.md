# 10,000 Arrows – Manifesto

## Purpose
10,000 Arrows is not a catalog. It is a hall.

It exists to present haiku as an experience: quiet, focused, and inviting.
The interface must serve the poem, not the other way around.

## Core Principle
A visitor should always arrive to a haiku.

The system must never render an empty state as the primary view.

## Visual Hierarchy
- The haiku is the center and the majority of the page.
- Navigation and discovery are subtle and secondary.
- Metadata is texture, not headline.

Rule: the first glance must land on poetry.

## Discovery Model
Discovery happens through intention, not clutter.

The home view offers a single Explore entry point with three paths:
- Explore by Tag
- Explore by Date
- Enter the Hall

Search inputs and dense tooling belong only in explorer views.

## Time Is Not Identity
Dates answer when a haiku was written, not why it should be read.

Dates may appear as:
- a watermark
- a footer detail
- revealed on interaction
- emphasized only in the Date Explorer

They must never compete visually with the poem.

## Always-On Content, Lazy-Loaded Structure
Poetry loads first. Structure follows.

- The most recent haiku is shown by default.
- If unavailable, a random haiku is selected.
- Indexes load asynchronously.
- The system always shows a haiku before metadata completes loading.

## Variation Without Distraction
Backgrounds may vary subtly:
- paper
- parchment
- archery hall walls
- rice paper

They must support stillness and legibility, never compete with text.

## About Is Context, Not Contact
About Haiku replaces Contact.

It explains:
- what this space is
- the lineage it draws from
- the intention behind the work

## Research Lives Next Door
Analytical and methodological work is real and valued, but external.

Links to research (stone word, turning word, energy density) lead to Back of the Napkin.
The hall remains a place of experience, not analysis.

## Kyūdō as Interaction Metaphor
The experience should feel like drawing the bow:
- one arrow at a time
- deliberate motion
- calm transitions
- generous space
